<h2>A Little History</h2>
<p>Let me start off by saying that the <a href="http://now.sprint.com/firsts/evo4g/">HTC EVO</a> has raised my expectations of what to expect from a smart phone.&#160; About two years ago, I switched to one of the first Android phones that came out.&#160; It had a very clunky keyboard slideout, it was very heavy, the interface was awkward and overall it was just not a good user experience.&#160; Even things like GMail did not work well.&#160; You could not do basic things like go from one email to the next without returning to the inbox first.</p>
<p>Fast Forward 18 months.&#160; I have a Palm Pre which I’m pretty happy with.&#160; It has a nice keyboard, nice email client for Microsoft Exchange, and though not many apps, it’s a pretty nice phone.&#160; It is pretty slow though.&#160; For example, sometimes a call comes in and the UI is so slow you can’t get it to actually answer the phone before it goes to voice mail.</p>
<p>Last Month, I took the plunge and bought the HTC EVO.&#160; I knew it did not have a keyboard, but I was hoping I could get use to that (not the first time I’ve been wrong).&#160; I did install a 3rd party application called SlideIT that did help some but still was not good enough.&#160; I made a huge number of mistakes in emails I sent out, practically to the point that I was about to put a message in my email signature saying “Sent using my Mobile SlideIT keyboard, pardon the mistakes”.&#160; I did not do that because somehow, as a technology guy, that just seemed wrong.</p>

<h2>Why I Returned the HTC EVO</h2>
<p>Yesterday, I returned my HTC EVO to the sprint store.&#160; The Samsung Epic 4G did not release until today so back to my Palm Pre I went.&#160; First, let me say the EVO was hugely better than my pre at almost everything (except the keyboard).&#160; Yesterday, I felt like I had gone back 100 years in technology.&#160; Browsing on the Palm Pre was horrible, the email was so slow and hard to read it hardly felt like a smart phone.&#160; My reasons for returning the HTC EVO are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Poor Battery Life.</strong>&#160; Without using any third party application to help, it would literally run out of battery around lunch time after a full charge in the morning.&#160; On those days, I had not used the EVO that much.&#160; The amazing lack of power management software on the EVO makes me more sympathetic to the IPhone’s lack of multi-tasking (which I assume is to preserve battery power).&#160; I did download an app called Juicer app from a company called latedroid that did help.&#160; I also downloaded a Task Manager from Adao Team which also helped.&#160; Still, not good enough.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard Not Good Enough.</strong>&#160; Even with the SlideIT keyboard, I could not get use to the lack of a physical keyboard.&#160; Too many mistakes. I am a fairly fast touch typer so maybe I’m spoiled.&#160; I can type pretty fast on a mobile keyboard without mistakes and I just could not match that on the on screen keyboard.&#160; Also, the SlideIT keyboard lacked some nice features that were part of the built in droid onscreen keyboard like the ability to hold a key and get a question mark, number, etc.&#160; That was nice. I also felt like the SlideIT keyboard slowed the EVO down but I’m not 100% sure of that.</p>
<p><strong>4G Not What I Had Hoped.</strong>&#160; I knew that we don’t have 4G in the San Francisco bay area so I did not expect to be able to use it at home. I do travel to Redmond, Washington often to visit Microsoft and I knew it would work there.&#160; I purchased the $30/month wifi tethering option so I thought this would be great for that.&#160; Also, since I own an IPad with no 3G service, I figured it would be great for connecting my IPad to the internet.&#160; Well, two things.&#160; 1) When it connected, it sucked battery like nothing I’ve ever seen and 2) it did not seem that much faster than 3G when I measured performance with speedtest.</p>
<p>To be fair, I’m not talking about the things I liked about the EVO.&#160; Those include great built in camera and flash, great HD Video capture, really fast 3G connections (much faster than my Palm Pre for some reason) and overall good android experience.&#160; I did ultimately return the phone without getting a replacement.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Purchasing the Samsung Epic 4G At the Spring Store</h2>
<p>Likely, if you are still reading, you know about the shortage of HTC EVO’s and the lines at sprint stores, still every morning to get EVO’s.&#160; For me, I waited one morning 30 minutes before the store opened to get my EVO.&#160; I was 5th in line for 4 phones but luckily for me, guy #3 was not eligible so I got a phone!</p>
<p>So, today is the launch of the <a href="http://now.sprint.com/epic4g/">Epic 4G</a>.&#160; I did not want to take any chances.&#160; I showed up at 6:45AM for an 8:00AM early store opening (the store normally opens at 10:00am).&#160; Well, person number 2 did not arrive until 7:40AM and considering they had 51 phones to sell, I think I over achieved on this one.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Finally, My First Impressions</p>
<p><strong>So far I love it</strong>.&#160; Let me list the things that jump out at me.&#160; Since I have not used the phone much, I will not provide much detail (because I don’t have any).</p>
<p><strong>Really Bright Gorgeous Screen.</strong> I had no complaints about the EVO screen but that said, this one is awesome.&#160; It’s really bright and really clear.</p>
<p><strong>Better Andorid UI.</strong>&#160; I thought that all Android phones would be created equal.&#160; Well, not quite so.&#160; The program launcher is very different.&#160; my first impression is that the Epic 4G’s launcher is cleaner and faster.</p>
<p><strong>Better on Screen Keyboard.</strong>&#160; Even though I don’t plan to use it much, the onscreen keyboard is easier to use and includes Slide without an addon (and it works well)</p>
<p><strong>Great Physical Keyboard.</strong>&#160; I love the keyboard so far. Nice size, nice slider, good feel.&#160; what else can I say.</p>
<p><strong>The Phone Feels Lighter</strong>.&#160; Though I don’t think numbers show that. Just an impression.</p>
<p><strong>Bigger SD Card From the factory.</strong>&#160; 16GB verses 8GB.&#160; Since I bought the navigator CoPilot, that takes 2GB by itself so that’s import to me.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Battery With Charger for $37.</strong>&#160; With my 25% discount for buying accessories with the phone, I got an extra battery and nice mobile charger for $37 (just in case)</p>
<p>That’s it for now.&#160; Hope this helps.</p>

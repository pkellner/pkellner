<p>Hello, Peter.<br />
We've met at the SVCC volunteer event.<br />
I'm writing for advice.  A friend and I are putting together a course on Spring and Hibernate.  We're planning to rent space for it.  Our concern is liability.  Is it necessary to have students provide emergency contact information and/or sign a liability waiver of some kind?<br />
Appreciate your advice,<br />
Thanks,<br />
Wendy<br />

<p>Hello Peter,</p>
<p>I downloaded your menu code from your website. but it is not working perfectly for me. I added a new menu “Home”. But it's not styled as other default menu is styled. It is calling “AspNet-Menu-Item” css class instead of “AspNet-Menu-TopLevel-home”. As i have written AspNet-Menu-TopLevel-home on style.css.. Can you please let me know  What need to change to assign a proper css class to my new menu or which one script assigning class to menu.</p>
<p>Looking for your help to make it work for me.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
Vicky<br />

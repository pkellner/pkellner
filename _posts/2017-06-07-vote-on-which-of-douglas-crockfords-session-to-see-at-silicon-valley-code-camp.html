<p><a href="https://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/session/2017/presenter/douglas-crockford-1124">Douglas Crockford</a>, the inventor of JSON and one of our top speakers at SV Code Camp is currently doing two talks, <a href="https://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Session/2017/numbers">Numbers</a> and <a href="https://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Session/2017/character-sets">Character Sets</a>. I've asked Doug if he'd reprise one of his more JavaScript / JSON sessions and he graciously offered me <a href="http://crockford.com/pp/">his list</a> to pick from.&#160; So, I'm turning that responsibility over to all of you.</p>
<p>Head over to twitter on this URL and&#160; <a href="https://twitter.com/sv_code_camp/status/872271126860226561"><b>VOTE</b></a>&#160; for what you want to see.&#160; While you are at it, follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/sv_code_camp">@sv_code_camp</a> twitter feed and you'll hear about every session approved and other important SV Code Camp announcements.</p>

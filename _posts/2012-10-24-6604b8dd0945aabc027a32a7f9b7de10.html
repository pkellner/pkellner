<p>Hi Peter,<br />
Can't blame you and Tammy for wanting to go bike in Italy after organizing such a cool code camp.<br />
Are Italy's campsites and small towns still as dirty as ever?</p>
<p>Meanwhile.... your road is not connected... nothing comes up with www.connectionroad.com except the root directory... in case you care.</p>

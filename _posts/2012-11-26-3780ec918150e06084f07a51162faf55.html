<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>I wanted to reach out to you as a new member of the Bay Area Sencha Meet up group.</p>
<p>Practice Fusion would be happy to host a Meet Up event if you need a venue.  We occupy a 3 story building a few blocks away from Union Square, so there is fairly easy BART access.  We have a very nice facility here.</p>
<p>We are building a tablet application in Sencha Touch over the last few months and are considering a rewrite of our flagship Flex application as well.</p>
<p>We will do our best to attend the Mountain View Meet Up as well so that we can meet in person.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Matthew O'Meara<br />

<p>[Développez.com] Proposal-request for authorization to translate articles/tutorials for French-speaking IT professionals</p>
<p>Hello Peter,</p>
<p>I am part of the Developpez.com (www.developpez.com) community team of moderators / writers / translators.</p>
<p>Developpez.com provides free access to all the useful services and resources needed by IT professionals and decision-makers:<br />
newsletter, magazine, news, tutorials, articles, FAQs, tests, comparative reviews, debates, polls, tools, source codes, components, blogs and free computer-science-related website hosting.</p>
<p>Developpez.com is the largest online community dedicated to French-speaking IT professionals:<br />
- More than 220,000 hits per day<br />
- Two and a half million distinct readers visit www.developpez.com at least once a month<br />

- The largest editorial team with over 1000 authors<br />
- 230,000 subscribers to our weekly newsletter</p>
<p>To provide even more quality content to the .NET category, I am proposing to translate the article that you have on Building a Windows 8 Touch application with WinRT JavaScript and Html5 (and any other articles/resources/tutorials that you might authorize), and that are available at the following address:<br />
http://peterkellner.net/</p>
<p>It seems appropriate to seek your approval and agreement regarding this matter.</p>
<p>The articles would be referred to as being a translation of the author's original work.<br />
Articles/resources translated and published this way include a link to the original article/resource published in English.</p>
<p>An example of my work which has already been translated and published on Développez.com can be found here:<br />
http://deepin.developpez.com/traductions/silverlight4-riaservices-pret-pour-les-affaires/</p>
<p>We do not charge authors for articles/resources that they authorize us to translate for and host on Développez.com.</p>
<p>Authors/teams who have authorized me to translate their articles/resources and have them published and hosted on Développez.com include, amongst others, MS Web Platform &amp; Tools Content Team, MS Visual Studio LightSwitch Team, MS SharePoint Developer Team, Jon Skeet, Eric Lippert, Jon Galloway, Alik Levin, Jeremy Likness, Rick Anderson, Glenn Gailey, Sacha Barber, Jaime Rodriguez, Oren Eini, Piotr Walat, Toni Petrina, Dominick Baier, Alex James, Dixin Yan, Jean Paul Va, Zain Naboulsi, Peter Torr, Imran Baloch, Gunnar Peipman, Radu Enuca, Shawn Hargreaves, Simone Chiaretta, Daniel Egan, Brandon Satrom, Dan Wahlin, Reed Copsey Jr., Chris O'Brien, Robert McMurray, Morteza Manavi, Gabriel Schenker, Maarten Balliauw, Bart-Jan Hoeijmakers, Bruno Terkaly, Jeff Barnes, Tom Hollander, Steve Peschka, Paolo Salvatori, Jim O'Neil, Richard Griffin, Deborah Kurata, Avkash Chauhan, Jeremy Jameson, Cihan Biyikoglu, Anweshi Deverasetty, Nikhil Sachdeva, Vivek Soni, Nandip Makwana, Manuel Felicio, Nikhil Kothari, Ron Jacobs, Kyle McClellan, Beth Massi, Itai Raz, Carlos Figueira, Mike Taulty, Jeff Blankenburg, Tim Heuer, Brad Abrams, Peter Bull, Josh Smith and Matthias Shapiro.</p>

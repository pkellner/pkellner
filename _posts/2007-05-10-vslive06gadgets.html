  <p>Tuesday (May 8th 2007) I did a presentation at VSLive in Orlando Florida on Gadgets.&nbsp;
  Specifically Vista Sidebar Gadgets.&nbsp; On stage, I build a complete Sidebar
  Gadget from scratch that displays information for our upcoming Silicon Valley
  Code Camp.&nbsp; Actually, the site still refers to last year, but the web
  service interface has been updated to show the new date which likely will be
  October 27th, 2007.</p>

<p> Yesterday (May 8th 2007) I did a presentation at VSLive in Orlando Florida on Gadgets.&#160; Specifically Vista Sidebar Gadgets.&#160; On stage, I build a complete Sidebar Gadget from scratch that displays information for our upcoming Silicon Valley Code Camp.&#160; Actually, the site still refers to last year, but the web service interface has been updated to show the new date which likely will be October 27th, 2007.</p>

<p>The gadget that was developed in the presentation is your basic countdown gadget.&#160; It counts down the number of days until our Silicon Valley upcoming codecamp.&#160; The way it discovers the date of the codecamp is using ajax.net to call a web service running on localhost.&#160; It also allows for a setting that lets you optionally turn off those annoying spinning hours, minutes and seconds.&#160; One more thing it does is to demonstrated the ability to project a dynamic gadget.&#160; That is, using a Gadget Flyout, it completely replaces a span element of the flyout with it's own HTML which is retrieved again, from a web service. </p>
<p>Below is a picture of the gadget.&#160; Also, I'm including a pointer to a zip file which is the gadget developed.&#160; Since it points to localhost, it will currently not function on your system but lets you see all the techniques. Keep an eye on this blog for a real gadget that works with the real codecamp site!</p>

<p> I’m doing two sessions at VS-Live in June.&#160; Both sessions are in the asp.net track. One is on High Speed performance in ASP.Net, and the other is on using <a href="http://extjs.com/">ExtJS</a> (a brilliantly fast rich JavaScript library).&#160; Hope to see you there!</p>
<p>Here are the descriptions:</p>
<p>VM1</p>
<h3><strong>Build Blazingly Fast ASP.NET Apps with 100% Clientside UI ExtJS</strong></h3>
<p>Peter Kellner </p>
<p><strong>Intermediate</strong></p>
<p>Need a web application that has the responsiveness and interactivity of a forms app but still looks and feels like a web? One of the best kept secrets (at least to the Microsoft community) is ExtJS. It's a different paradigm then we are all use to, but the results are spectacular. Take a look at this url and you will see as well as learn how to do this yourself. The hardest part is shuttling the data back and forth. A lot of this session will be talking about how to do a real world app that does this. Once you go this way, you'll be gone from serverside forms for almost ever.</p>

<p>VM10</p>
<h3>Building High Performance ASP.NET Web Applications </h3>
<p>Peter Kellner </p>
<p><strong>Intermediate</strong></p>
<p>Topics will include appropriate use of Cache and Session State, as well as how and when to use them. Viewstate management and methods to minimize its use will be discussed. Code to pop up a warning when a threshold is met in development will be shown. When and how to take advantage of Server Farms will be discussed, as well as trouble shooting techniques to find problems. The evils of Server Affinity, as well as a common pattern for caching database queries will be shown to be wrong. Time permitting, we will talk about using Microsoft’s Ajax.asp.net with UpdatePanel and webservices and how these affect performance and scalability.</p>

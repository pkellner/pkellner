<p>Neither my old password NOR the new password that the site sent me works for logging into http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com</p>
<p>My username is lt@x.com. I am unable to log in to the Code Camp site using any device.</p>
<p>I have already tried the "Forgot Password" system three or four times. Each time, the site sends me a new password and it does not work.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if you could fix your system. </p>
<p>I spent HOURS going through all the session descriptions to determine which sessions I want to attend, and to build up my personal schedule. I was expecting to be able to login to refer to it during the code camp. I cannot afford to spend several more hours doing all that research again. </p>
<p>Can you solve this?<br />
Thanks,</p>
<p>Lisa<br />

<p>I like this term I keep hearing (repaved) which means that I’ve wiped out all the information on my computer and reinstalled the operating system.&#160; The interesting thing about the term is that there actually is a term.&#160; As a software guy, one of the fears I have is that problems that I might create in my code will so common that they will get a name.&#160; That is, is there anyone out there that does not know the term “Blue Screen of Death”.&#160; If it did not happen so often, it would not have a name.</p>

<p>Well, seems to me that the reason we talk about repaving is because we have to do it so much.</p>
<p>So, why did I repave? I had to because I was running Windows 7 RC and my Lenovo W500 started getting pretty sick with it.&#160; Finally, it got to the point that it would boot off my docking station but not on it’s own.</p>
<p>So far, things are working well with RTM.&#160; It feels cleaner, and maybe even a little faster.</p>

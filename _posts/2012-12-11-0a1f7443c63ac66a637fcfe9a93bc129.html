<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I maintain www.techiwarehouse.com which has page rank 4. We want to do link exchange with your website.</p>
<p>Everyone offers to exchange links with a good and popular website. But it involves putting a link of your site along with 50 others in a list, shown on a page that nobody would even go to. It's mainly done for search engine rankings but let's not kid ourselves. We all created our websites for people first right? If we only wanted higher search engine ranking and no human being to visit us, what good would that do?</p>
<p>We at TW have taken a different approach. We welcome link exchanges from a whole host of sites. As long as it's targeted relevant subject matter. And what do we provide in return? Your link will not be drowned in a list of 100 others in a list called "LINKS". We will show your website link on a relevant page (example: A+ Certification Category) and in a human readable area that's not obscure.  Exchanging links with similar websites (unless done in excess) will not be seen as a link scheme since it does help determine that others in your field see your site as worthy to link to.</p>
<p> If you are interested then please contact me.</p>

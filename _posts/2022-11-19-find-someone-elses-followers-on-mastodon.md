excerpt: It's tricky to see someone else's followers on Mastodon and then follow those you are interested in. In this article I'll give an explanation around how I do that with my particular server.<a rel="me" href="https://techhub.social/@pkellner">@pkellner@techhub.social</a>. So far it's looking good. A lot more to learn about it.

## The Problem

In Twitter, it's easy to view another users followers and follow the ones you are interested in. That's because
twitter runs on a centralized infrastructure and the instance running your session has access directly to all
twitter users everywhere.

In Mastodon, not so much. Looking at someone else's followers requires bouncing between different "federated" Mastodon servers
all over the internet. I just read that there are over 7000 Mastodon servers right now that are being used in a big way. I'm sure that
number will go up in a big way very quickly.

## The Steps (On My Server, techhub.social)

First, log in to your own Mastodon server.  When I do that, I get this screen


![Mastodon Home Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkellner/pkellner/gh-pages/blogimages/2022-11-19-find-someone-elses-followers-on-mastodon/homescreen.png)

You then copy the Mastodon user you want to see the followers from into the search text input on the top left of this screen

![Mastodon Follow Field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkellner/pkellner/gh-pages/blogimages/2022-11-19-find-someone-elses-followers-on-mastodon/follow2.png)

Press Enter while in that input field

This gives us a screen on the right that shows George's following and followers, so click on the following link above George's name

![Mastodon Follow Field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkellner/pkellner/gh-pages/blogimages/2022-11-19-find-someone-elses-followers-on-mastodon/follow4.png)

And then on the bottom, you get a button titled "Browse more on the original profile, click that"

Click on his followings and painfully, one at a time go through the list of followings

![Mastodon Follow Field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkellner/pkellner/gh-pages/blogimages/2022-11-19-find-someone-elses-followers-on-mastodon/follow8.png)

right clicking on that name and choosing copy link `https://universeodon.com/@kathygriffin@mstdn.social`

![Mastodon Follow Field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkellner/pkellner/gh-pages/blogimages/2022-11-19-find-someone-elses-followers-on-mastodon/follow9.png)

And then, you can finally press the "follow" "plus" button.

<h2>The Visual Basic Version of the Objects!</h2>
<p>Back in January of 2006, I published on <a href="/2006/01/09/microsoft-aspnet-20-memberrole-management-with-iis/">MSDN an article and source code for managing ASP.NET 2.0 Membership users with an ObjectDataSource.</a>&#160; Since I'm not much of a VB person, I only published them in c#.&#160; since then, I've had hundreds of requests for this code in VB.&#160; Until now, I've had to send an excuse for not having it. Now, thanks to Dave at&#160; <a href="http://www.tangiblesoftwaresolutions.com/">Tangible Solutions Software</a>, we now have a VB version.&#160; Dave converted it with there conversion software called <em>Instant VB</em>.</p>
<p class="style1">The following zip file includes these VB objects along with a very simple aspx page in VB.&#160; It does not include any more complete examples of using the objects because the code associated with the aspx pages I wrote is all in c#.&#160; If anyone wants to convert the other pages, I'd be happy to post those also.</p>
<p class="style1">Thanks Dave and Thanks Tangible Solutions!    <br /><a href="http://peterkellner.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/MembershipEditorVB.zip">     <br />http://peterkellner.net/DownLoads/MembershipEditorVB.zip</a></p>

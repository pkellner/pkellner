<p>I recently went to a big <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh868262.aspx">Windows 8</a> developer event at the Mountain View Microsoft office and I heard for the first time a really good explanation for why Metro is, well the way Metro is.&#160; One of the original UI architects spoke and made this argument that I’ve never heard before.&#160; I’ll try to do my best to recall what he said with making too much up so here it goes.</p>
<p>He said that with one of the first Metro UI builds that basically looks like the current Metro interface, Microsoft brought in a bunch of people for a study.&#160; They asked them sit in front of a class Windows Desktop and do a bunch of stuff, then sit in front of a Metro interface and do some stuff.&#160; In other words, basically here is what they were looking at:</p>
<p><a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/image16.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/image_thumb14.png" width="244" height="139" /></a></p>
<p>versus</p>
<p><a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/image17.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/image_thumb15.png" width="244" height="193" /></a></p>
<p>(sorry about the size differences, that’s not really relevant here)</p>
<p>Microsoft then asked the participants to draw what they remembered from each interface.&#160; For Window classic, they drew the following:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p> <a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Photo-Apr-25-11-06-05-PM.jpg"><img title="Photo Apr 25, 11 06 05 PM" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Photo Apr 25, 11 06 05 PM" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Photo-Apr-25-11-06-05-PM_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="183" /></a>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For Metro, they drew this:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p> <a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Photo-Apr-25-11-05-57-PM.jpg"><img title="Photo Apr 25, 11 05 57 PM" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Photo Apr 25, 11 05 57 PM" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Photo-Apr-25-11-05-57-PM_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="183" /></a>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Microsoft’s conclusion was that Metro is all about the content and Windows class is all about the stuff around the content.&#160; It seems obvious that the OS should be about the content and not the plumbing.</p>
<p>So, there you have it, with the exception of one thing (which is actually what’s motivating this post).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Unless you have been living under a stone, I think we all know that the Apple OSX operating system has been getting more and more popular.&#160; it’s design is even further away from the windows class desktop.&#160; That is, not only to the launch places have to do with edges and corners, the menu itself is glued to the top no matter what program you are running.</p>
<p>I recently noticed this article posted that showed that in full detail:</p>
<p><a href="http://macwinguy.com/2012/04/where-did-my-menu-go/">http://macwinguy.com/2012/04/where-did-my-menu-go/</a></p>
<p>It shows that the mac window all about edges.</p>
<p><a href="http://macwinguy.com/2012/04/where-did-my-menu-go/"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/image18.png" width="244" height="235" /></a></p>
<p>So, there you have it.&#160; I’m now perplexed.</p>

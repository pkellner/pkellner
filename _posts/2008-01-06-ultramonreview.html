<p>I've been addicted to using multiple monitors for programming for many years now.&#160; Recently (through other MVP blogs), I've noticed people talking about using <a href="http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/">UltraMon</a> as a &quot;must have&quot; if you use multiple monitors. Frankly, I couldn't see how it could get much better, but after using it for just a couple days, I'm hooked!&#160; There are lots of features to the product that I don't yet know about or have played with, but the ones I have used so far have been very nice.&#160; I'll outline them here.</p>
<p>First, it's really nice to be able use one picture to cover your complete desktop (in my case, three monitors).&#160; While in New Zealand in 2003 on a bike vacation, I took this panorama picture.&#160; I forget where it is, but if any of you know, please add it to the comments.&#160; Here is a picture of that picture.</p>
<p><a href="http://peterkellner.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ultramon4.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="ultramon4" src="http://peterkellner.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ultramon4-thumb.jpg" width="244" height="87" /></a></p>

<p>Secondly, and also very helpful is that you now can have toolbbars on each monitor so you don't have to guess where things are going to pop up.&#160; It also helps decrease the clutter on your primary toolbar.&#160; No more hunting for programs because you have so many open!&#160; Here is a screen shot.&#160; Notice the toolbars on the right edge of each monitor.&#160; (you may have to click on the image to actually see them.</p>
<p><a href="http://peterkellner.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ultramon2.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="ultramon2" src="http://peterkellner.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ultramon2-thumb.jpg" width="244" height="61" /></a></p>
<p>The third thing I really like is the cool feature where UltraMon adds a buttons to your program menu that lets you move any program to any screen, and another button that lets you maximize your program across all your monitors.&#160; Here is a screen shot of what is added to outlook.</p>
<p><a href="http://peterkellner.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ultramon3.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="ultramon3" src="http://peterkellner.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ultramon3-thumb.jpg" width="244" height="112" /></a></p>
<p>UltraMon also adds to your taskbar a configuration panel that you can right click on for lots of other things which I will explore soon.&#160; Here is what that looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://peterkellner.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ultramon1.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="ultramon1" src="http://peterkellner.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ultramon1-thumb.jpg" width="186" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>That's it for now.&#160; Just a quick post to let everyone know about this cool new program.&#160; I highly recommend it.&#160; You can find more details at their web site.&#160; </p>

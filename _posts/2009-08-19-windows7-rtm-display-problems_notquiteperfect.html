<p>Yesterday, someone asked me if I had a chance to install Windows 7 on my Lenovo W500 notebook computer.&#160; Well, I said yet, three times.</p>
<p>It started when Windows 7 Beta came out.&#160; My Vista had gotten sufficiently slow that I decided I needed to reinstall something.&#160; Being the adventurous type, I decided to give it a go, but with a “goback” plan.&#160; My go back plan was to install al the programs on drive C in my 2nd hard drive (in the media bay), then put all my personal data on my built in hard drive.&#160; That way, I could easily switch back to vista by simply popping out the removable drive and putting in my vista boot drive.</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>I never actually did go back to vista, but there were times I did waste a lot of time when I probably should have.&#160; Beta was pretty frustrating.&#160; Drivers were not so good, some crashing, some hanging, but not surprising.&#160; RC was actually fatal.&#160; My computer completely stopped booting when it was not docked.&#160; Luckily RTM had just arrived so I repaved.&#160; Sadly now, with RTM, I’m starting to have the same booting problem.&#160; It gets past the first windows logo, then boots (but you’d never know it).&#160; If docked, no problem.&#160; I’m on an airplane now and my docking station is far far away.</p>
<p>The last thing I did was change my bios display config to “no OS detection on graphics card” and “Discrete mode” and it did boot this time.&#160; No science on this because sometimes it would just work anyhow.</p>
<p>Anyone has more data on this, let me know.&#160; Could be my notebook is hosed.&#160; Who knows.&#160; For now I’m up and not going to shutdown until the pry the keyboard from my laptop tray.</p>
<p>(I’m also not completely sure it’s not a hardware problem)</p>

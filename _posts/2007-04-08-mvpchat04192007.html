<h2>Mark Your Calendars!</h2>
<h2>Ask All Your Questions Real Time!</h2>
<p>On April 19th at 11:30 AM PST, I will be joining a panel of ASP.NET experts&#160; in a live chat to answer as many questions as we can for two hours.&#160; For&#160; those of you that are MVP's and don't know about this, it is a great&#160; opportunity for us to interact with our peer MVP's.&#160; For ASP.NET users at large,&#160; this is a great opportunity to get your questions answered. </p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>The format is&#160; basically as you'd expect a chat room to be.&#160; You post your questions and&#160; the panel of experts answers them.&#160; The reason this is so successful is&#160; that the Microsoft Chat Software allows the experts (us MVP's) to grab questions and answer them.&#160; Our first chat did not have this software working well and was    <br />kind of chaotic.&#160; Now that the software is working, it allows for very smooth flow of questions and answers.&#160; In addition, the experts are all on a conference phone line so that when we get stumped, we can all talk about the     <br />issue to insure the best answer is delivered.</p>
<p>This will be my third time participating in these chats and believe me, it's worth the time.&#160; Come join the fun!&#160; I wish when I was learning ASP.NET this was available.&#160; It would have been a huge help.</p>
<p>The URL you should go to is this:&#160; <br /><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/chats/default.aspx">     <br />http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/chats/default.aspx</a>.&#160; From there, you should be able to find the link to the ASP.NET MVP Chat.&#160; Hope to see you there.</p>

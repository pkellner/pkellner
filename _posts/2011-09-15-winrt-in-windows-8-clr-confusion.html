<p>I’m here at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">BUILD</a> conference in Anaheim and am very much enjoying all the announcements surrouding the next major release of Windows (at least a year or two out).&#160; One of the big speculations that has drawn a lot of confusion over the past few months is whether .Net is going to part of the next generation of Windows.&#160; It seems that Microsoft had been telegraphing quite a bit about how C++ will be the language of choice to program going into the Microsoft future.</p>
<p>Well, I’m sure that .Net is a part of Windows 8. I also now know that if you want to continue to write c# or vb code for the “new” part of Windows 8 (Metro) you can, however Microsoft has created a new API they are calling WinRT.&#160;&#160; WinRT does have a full CLR and the languages c# and vb will be supported.&#160; However, the API you call has changed.&#160; Miguel has a great article that explains much of this here:&#160; <a title="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/Sep-15.html" href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/Sep-15.html">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/Sep-15.html</a></p>
<p>It’s a brave new world!&#160; Much has changed, much is the same.</p>

<p>I’ve been listening to the podcast recently <a href="http://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular/">Adventures in Angular</a> and in particular the “Podcaster Picks” at the end of each podcast.&#160; At first I thought this was pretty silly but have been surprised that many of the picks I did not know about and have been quite useful.&#160; So, in the Holiday spirit of giving, here is my pick for the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clear-cache/cppjkneekbjaeellbfkmgnhonkkjfpdn">Clear Cache from Benjamoin Bojko</a></p>
<h3>Motivation For Needing this</h3>
<p>I’ve been doing a lot of JavaScript programming for the past couple years and Chrome Dev Tools is my debugger of choice.&#160; It’s amazing easy to clear cache which is something I do quite often.&#160; To be clear, all I have to do is:&#160; 1) Tools Pull down then 2) select “clear cache” and finally 3) select the URL in the browser and press refresh.&#160; I just timed this and it takes me about 2.5 seconds.&#160; I could do the keyboard short cuts and maybe shave it down to 1.5 seconds but I switch back and forth between OSX and Windows quite a bit and the key strokes are slightly different so I just do the menus.</p>
<p>Today, I decided to spent 5 minutes hunting for a chrome extension thinking I could use a little more DRY (don’t repeat yourself) in my life and shave a second off my life.</p>
<h3>Why I Like Clear Cache</h3>
<ul>
<li>It has lots of users so it likely gets attention</li>
<li>It puts itself on my toolbar</li>
<li>It only requires one click to execute</li>
<li>It refreshes the current URL after clearing just the parts of cache I want</li>
</ul>

<p>Very nice!&#160; HTH’s.</p>

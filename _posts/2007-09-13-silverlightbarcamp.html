<p>SilverlightDevCampSF is an upcoming gathering, inspired by <a href="http://www.barcamp.org">BarCamp</a>, to build <a href="http://silverlight.net">Silverlight</a> applications, It's organized by volunteers &amp; Silverlight enthusiasts, with attendance free to all. At this event, I will be presenting a 30 minute presentation on how to build animation into a Silverlight application. I'll talk about the implementation details of building the picture slider used in the Community Media Browser preview hosted at     </p>
<p>http://labs.leveragesoftware.com/gallery.html .&#160; In this informal talk I'll discuss how LoadXaml() was critical to this process as well as other tricks.&#160; Because the picture slider is running from a live web feed, there is no way to know ahead of time how many picture we may have to scroll so clipping type solutions just don't make sense.&#160; Time permitting, we'll talk about other issues involved in building this application and of course take     <br />questions.</p>

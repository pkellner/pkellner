<p>Today, I’m both pleased and proud to offer my 7<sup>th</sup> course from Pluralsight and my first one on React. For 10 years now, I’ve been focused on Single Page JavaScript apps that work really well with back end servers.</p>

<p>I continue to believe that for anyone building enterprise quality apps, the Single Page App (also known as SPA’s), are the way to go.&nbsp; If you really think about it, it makes total sense. Why is that? It’s because you can write your code in a natural way. You don’t have a ridiculous HTML DOM backend server interaction around your UI events that makes programming a nightmare. Your user click a button, an event is attached the button, JavaScript executes and everything is running in one place.</p>
<p>No crazy postback semantics to manage and program around like in php or other, in my opinion, convoluted programming paradigms.</p>
<p>So why Facebooks <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>? Because simply, it’s the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> Single Page App library out there. Personally, I know I’ll get some flack for this, I love JavaScript and especially the new features including things like lambda’s, spread operators, and promises.</p>
<p>Unlike other SPA’s, react fits like a glove to these new features and it just feels second nature to programming JavaScript.&nbsp; The learning curve is super friendly, refactoring is easy and productivity for me is high.</p>
<p>My course, React and <a href="https://www.asp.net/">ASP.NET Core</a>, is just over 3 hours and is can be viewed with a <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1196644/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fauthors%2Fpeter-kellner">Pluralsight subscription</a>, but if you don’t have Pluralsight account, check out the next few minutes where I’ve included a couple clips teaching how to access REST Services, a little bit of debugging with Redux and integrating with ASP.NET Core and the create-react-app templating system.</p>
<p>Of course, don’t forget, that I’m an independent consultant also, and if you need help with projects or custom videos for your company that better serve your needs then a generic training course, I can help with that to.&nbsp; Reach out to me at my web site <a href="http://peterkellner.net">http://peterkellner.net</a> and click on the contact page.</p>

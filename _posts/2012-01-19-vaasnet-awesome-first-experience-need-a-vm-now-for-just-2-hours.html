<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I’ve known about <a href="http://www.vaasnet.com/">vaasnet</a> for quite a while.&#160; Basically, <a href="http://www.vaasnet.com/">vaasnet</a> is a way to almost instantly (OK, it took about 4 seconds to come up) grab a fresh VM (currently 99 cents an hour), do a bunch of stuff and go away.&#160; My bunch of stuff was I need to download a bittorrent file that was about 5 gig and I know if I do it from either home or over my hotspot, bad things will happen.&#160; If I do it at home, <a href="http://xfinity.comcast.net/?">Comcast</a> will send me a letter accusing me of stealing something, and if I use my <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/index.html">Verizon</a> hotspot, well, it’s a 5 gig per month plan.&#160; You do the math.</p>
<p>Back to vaasnet.&#160; Here is my experience today:</p>
<ol>
<li>30 seconds to put my credit card it</li>
<li>4 seconds to boot a general purpose workstation</li>
<li>5 seconds to RDP into it</li>
<li>2 minutes to download bit torrent</li>
<li>35 minutes to have bit torrent download a 5 gig file!</li>
<li>35 minutes to have bit torrent download a 5 gig file (had to say it twice)</li>
<li>1 minute to transfer the file to my <a href="http://www.orcsweb.com/">ORCSWeb</a> server I already have</li>
<li>$1.70 billed to my credit card.</li>
<li>OMG!</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that about says it all.&#160; OK, maybe not it all.</p>
<p>I’ll be back!</p>
<p>OK, now that says it all.</p>

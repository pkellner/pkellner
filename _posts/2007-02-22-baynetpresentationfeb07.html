<p><strong>(The Screen Saga Continues)</strong></p>

<p>Last night, I presented to the San Francisco Bay.Net Users Group my talk on integrating ObjectDataSource and .NetTiers.&#160; Except for my notebook computer not playing with the projector at the Microsoft office, it went pretty well.&#160; I could get multiple screens to work (extended) but not mirrored screens.&#160; My neck is still a little sore from having to look up at the screen while I talked.</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>Lots of interesting questions from the crowd.&#160; This group clearly has opinions on which DAL's to use.&#160; Lots of active discussions of the good bad and ugly of Typed DataSets, as well as other tools for the same ORM purpose.</p>

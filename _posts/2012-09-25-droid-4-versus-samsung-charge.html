<h2>A Little Background</h2>
<p>As many of you know, I’ve been slowly pulled to the dark side and use both a macbook and IPad.&#160; I still use an android phone though so I have not been completely subsumed.&#160; About 18 months ago, I started using a Samsung Charge.&#160; A very pretty 4G Verizon phone with a great screen, single core processor and no keyboard.&#160; Three months ago, I finally gave in and replaced with with a Droid 4 with a keyboard.&#160; I just could not get use to no keyboard.</p>
<p>Well, today, biking down Mt. Hamilton (an 18 mile descent), I believe my Droid 4 jumped from my pocket and is somewhere on the road.&#160; So, I went home, got my old Samsung Charge and took it to Verizon to reactivate it.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Samsung Charge</h2>
<p>Even after replacing the battery with an extended life battery, the battery life is miserable.&#160; Out of battery most days before 2pm without even using it a lot.&#160; Over time, I learned to hate this phone because it is so slow.&#160; I could sometimes wait 30 seconds after pressing “send” for a mail message to go out.&#160; It does have an&#160; Awesome screen!</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Droid 4</h2>
<p>The battery is not removable so the one that comes in it is all you have.&#160; I found it good enough.&#160;&#160; Lasted most days until at least dinner time.&#160; The screen is pretty good, though when I went back to using the Samsung Charge, I realized that the Droid 4 screen is not nearly as good.&#160; Performance with the dual core is great.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The Samsung screen is much brighter and more crisp.&#160; The Droid 4 battery life is much better and the Droid 4 performance is much better.</p>

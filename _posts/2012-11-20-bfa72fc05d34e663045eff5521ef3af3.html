<p>Good afternoon, Mr. Kellner. </p>
<p>I just left you a voicemail message, but basically I'm curious what you, as an organizer of Silicon Valley Code Camp, think of Charleston's CODEcamp: http://www.chscodecamp.com/. They're two sessions in, and I'm writing an article about how the program's gone so far. Please give me a call when you get this message at 843-937-5906.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, and I hope to speak with you soon.</p>
<p>Brendan<br />

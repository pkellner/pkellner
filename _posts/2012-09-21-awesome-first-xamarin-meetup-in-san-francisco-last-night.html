<p>As the organizer of a new meetup, it’s always a little nerve racking when the first one happens.&#160; One wonders weather you and two other people will come, it the other choice.&#160; In this case, I’d say we were an overwhelming success!&#160; about 15 new people came, two cofounders of <a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a>, the new developer evangelist and a bunch of enthusiastic developers.&#160; </p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>We started the meeting by going around and having everyone introduce themselves and give there level of experience using xamarin development tools on a scale of 1 to 5.&#160; No one claimed higher than three, but having talked to many of the folks afterwards, it was clear there were many 5’s in the room.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will be the start of a very fun run of meetups!</p>

ChatGPT is awesome for helping in programming but it's not up to the task of being an expert system. I'd say it's more like a beginner programming helper that really does not know the difference between good and bad. It will improve it's results on request, but still, you really need to understand what's going on in the language of your choice if you want to use it.

I've got a short demo here of creating a simple list of cookies in a React app and you can see how badly ChatGPT got lost.



And, below is my dialog with ChatGPT where I'm trying to get it to help me with a React app.

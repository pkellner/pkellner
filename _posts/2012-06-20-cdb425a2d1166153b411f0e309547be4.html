<p>I'm having an awful time registering for Code Camp this year.  I tried to fill out the logon as a new user, but when I entered the form it complained that my email address had been used before.  (I attended last year.)  </p>
<p>So I tried to "hack" my way through my own logon, guessing what I might have used for user name and password.  After some futile attempts, I clicked the "lost password" link and got a site error.</p>
<p>Help!!<br />

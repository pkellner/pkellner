<p>Last week, while at Microsoft’s TechEd 2010, Mehul Harry, Technical Evangalist for <a href="http://community.devexpress.com/">Developer Express</a>, interviewed me about our upcoming <a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com">Silicon Valley Code Camp</a> (of which Dev Express is a platinum sponsor).&#160; There was huge giveaway (for an expensive motorcycle) in the next booth so it was really noisy.&#160; Mehul had the recorder about 6 inches from my nose which made me pretty nervous.&#160; I think I’m moving my head so much because I was trying to get away, but there was not place to go.</p>

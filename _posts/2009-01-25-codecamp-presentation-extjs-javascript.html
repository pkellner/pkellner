<p>It was fun to do <a href="http://www.socalcodecamp.com/session.aspx?sid=33e8ceaf-6812-4310-8070-e54fed099a6d">my first presentation on ExtJS</a> at the <a href="http://www.socalcodecamp.com/default.aspx">Southern California Rock and Roll Code Camp</a> at <a href="http://www.fullerton.edu/">Fullerton</a>.&#160; It was also great to see so many friends.&#160; As promised, I'm attaching the code and PowerPoint here.&#160; I started my talk with a little introduction on RIA (rich internet applications), then moved into <a href="http://extjs.com">ExtJS</a>.&#160; I realize now, that because the audience all pretty much knew the RIA story, it would have been better to just dive into ExtJS.&#160; As it was, I ran out of time.&#160; Next time, I'll go with plan B.</p>
<p>My guess is we had about 50 people in the room.&#160; I took a picture about 10 minutes before class started that I'm showing below.&#160; I'm thinking a lot more showed up after the picture.&#160; The guy in the second row mentioned that they should be taking a picture of me, but then, I was running out of prep time so I figured I better go with what I had.</p>

<p>One thing that came up often was how to interact with the ExtJS library.&#160; I did talk a bunch about another open source project (<a href="http://coolite.com">Coolite</a>) that has lots of asp.net stuff (custom controls) to help with that.&#160; they wrap all the things you expect from asp.net like SqlDataSource,ObjectDataSource, etc.&#160; Overall, it's a great product and a huge help in learning ExtJS.</p>

<p>And, Here is the code:&#160; (much of this code comes from adaptations of code I got at a <a href="http://extjs.com/support/training/">ExtJS training class put on by ExtJS</a> themselves.&#160; BTW, it was an awesome class!)&#160;&#160; </p>

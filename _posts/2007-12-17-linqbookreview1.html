<p> Now that <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx">Visual Studio 2008</a> has RTM' d, I'm very motivated to learn LINQ.&#160; Like most of us, I've read articles, seen presentations, talked a lot about it, but now, it's time to begin in earnest.&#160; What does that mean?&#160; Time to get the books and start doing some serious examples myself.&#160; I just bought the book &quot;<em>Pro LINQ Language Integrated Query in C# 2008</em>&quot; and so far am very impressed.&#160; Because I'm a total newbie to link, I started with the first chapter (very unusual for me).&#160; That was a good overview of the different types of LINQ.&#160; One thing I learned was that all those names like dlinq,xlinq, etc. are no longer valid.&#160; I kind of thought that, but couldn't find it written explicitly anywhere's else.&#160; I think it's one of those things everyone knew but me.</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>The second chapter is really where it's at for me.&#160; I went to sleep reading it (no insult intended, I was just tired) and plan on continuing today on my train ride to San Francisco.&#160; It's doing an excellent job of explaining Lambda expressions.&#160; Before reading it, I really didn't get what they were, but I feel like I really understand now.&#160; I always knew they were related to delegates somehow.&#160; This chapter does a great job of taking the reader through a progression (named delegate, anonymous delegate, then finally Lambda Expression) to explain how they work.&#160; I hate to say I needed that, but I really did.</p>
<p>Obviously, I recommend this book for your library.</p>

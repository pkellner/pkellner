<p>Good comfortable Winter replica christian louboutin shoes uk that are still fitting enough to go beneath bootleg jeans as well as above tight fit jeans; taken a lot of will power to continue wearing last years boots alongside.I already own a pair of these christian louboutin in red and they are amazing. height with comfort. I can run around in these all day and night with no sore feet or back. The only down fall is that if you are driving, the rubber on the heels will rub and wear down on the car mats. To get around this you can put 100% wool mats down. Can't wait till winter to rock these babies. UK size 8 fits perfectly. I take a US 10.I already own a pair of replica christian louboutin. They have served me well but were looking a bit worn. I have big feet and muscely calves so usually get calf length boots. Was going to buy another pair of Mes but saw the Vale Wedge and fell in love. I have big feet and muscley calves so long boots are usually not an option. I read the reviews and bought them. I ordered them last night and they arrived this morning. They are a beautiful pair of boots. They fit perfectly. They are also very comfortable. It feels like your walking on a cushion. They make my legs look extra long. I highly recommend these boots. Yes they are expensive but worth every pound.<br />

excerpt: "<p>With the current incarnation of Beta 2 of Microsoft’s Visual Studio 2005
  (Whidbey), there is no “out of the box” solution for maintaining the membership
  and role databases in IIS.  This is a problem when you move your application from
  development to a production IIS server.  The utility Microsoft provides, ASP.NET
  Web Configuration, only works in single user development mode using the built in
  Casini web server.  This article and its associated code, solves the problem of
  not being able to run on IIS by implementing a three tier solution to the member
  and role management while using standard ASP.NET tools.  This means it will run
  in any ASP.NET 2.0 environment including IIS.  The solution is flexible and very
  easy to add to any existing ASP.NET 2.0 web site project.</p>"

<h2>June CTP (Community Technical Preview)</h2>
<p>Atlas is still in beta from Microsoft and because of this, code that worked in previous CTP versions of Atlas may not work with later CTP's. This is exactly what happened with the version of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479398.aspx">MSDN article</a> built with the March CTP version of Atlas. The link below is to revised Atlas Membeship Management source.</p>

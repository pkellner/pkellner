<p>
  Let's face it, the internet can be slow sometimes and you want your browser
  users to have a good experience when they view your pages. When we are
  building server side SPA apps, we often first download the html, then that
  html downloads some JavaScript that includes the Facebook library React, then
  finally, the JavaScript executes and fetches some data.
</p>
<p>
  In this post, I talk about how the SPA (Single Page App) technology is React
  from Facebook.  The library that does the REST data call is Axios, and of
  course the logic is mine.

  and don't forget to add some claps if you like it. It's my first post on
  Medium and I'm trying to decide if that is a good place to write stuff.

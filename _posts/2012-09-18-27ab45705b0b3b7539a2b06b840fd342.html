<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>I learn about you from Tim Chandler a tech mentors. I'm currently looking for some developper able to help us to modify a little bit the new windows 8 UI.</p>
<p>Ideally we would like to resize the windows 8 UI (1366 x 515 px)to fit perfectly our screen, and to set it in order to have it on the bottom screen of our computer directly instead of the display screen, keeping the touch capabilities of the bottom screen.<br />
(more details and picture available on www.najmtek.com )</p>
<p>We would like to make Windows 8 works on this way:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw6RwubdWUk&amp;feature=plcp&amp;noredirect=1</p>
<p>Let me know if you can help us for such a development, and how long it will take. Let me know also the price. </p>
<p>If you can't do it for us, please let me know where I can send my request. It may be helpful. </p>
<p>Feel free to email me back for further informations if needed. Many thanks in advance for the help you will provide. </p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Sophie<br />

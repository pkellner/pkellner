<p>I love the simplicity of using ASP.NET WebAPI for building simple web rest services.&#160; No special calls to create JSON, simple REST conventions implemented with the methods GET,POST,PUT and DELETE and very straight forward interfaces.</p>
<p>The thing that annoys me is the naming convention.&#160; In my case, I’ve create a folder /rest on my web server and I put all my WebAPI controllers there.&#160; An example of a controller looks as follows:</p>
<pre lang="c#"> 
public class FaqController : ApiController
    {
        public HttpResponseMessage Get(int? id = null, string urlPart = null, int? arrayonly = null)
        {</pre>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The problems comes up when you decide you want to have a different FAQ controller for different parts of the web site.&#160; The obvious solution is to drop the REST services into sub directories.&#160; Unfortunately, since the class name above does not change, you have conflict.&#160; I’m guessing there is some attribute to solve this but it just feels clunky to me.</p>

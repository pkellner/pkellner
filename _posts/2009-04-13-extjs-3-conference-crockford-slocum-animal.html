<p>&#160;<a href="http://extjs.com">ExtJS</a> is having it’s first conference.&#160; The JavaScript software company is releasing 3.0 of it’s flagship software.&#160; As many of you know, I’m using ExtJS quite extensively now and am very impressed with the quality of the library, as well as the outstanding people who make it.&#160; I was fortunate enough to be at the right place and time today to join them as well as their featured keynote speaker, <a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/">Douglas Crockford</a> for dinner.&#160; Below is our group.</p>
<p><a href="http://peterkellner.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/extconfdinner.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="extconfdinner" border="0" alt="extconfdinner" src="http://peterkellner.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/extconfdinner_thumb.jpg" width="680" height="401" /></a></p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>In addition to Douglas Crockford, we had Jack Slocum, the founder of ExtJS, Abe Elias the CEO and Aaron Conran, head of professional services.</p>
<p>I should also mention, I spent several hours hanging around the pool today with Chris Scott, the senior ExtJS developer responsible for a lot of the code in ExtJS 3.0 that deal with databases (my personal favorite).&#160; I also talked to EvanTrimboli, the ExtJS senior ExtJS developer from Australia who did the asp.net implementation of the Direct Router.</p>
<p>That it for now.&#160; Looking forward to see what ExtJS has in 3.0 which releases tomorrow!</p>

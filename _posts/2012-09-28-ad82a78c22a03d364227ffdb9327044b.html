<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>I am Hyacintha D'Souza , an E- Learning Content Editor with Packt Publishing.</p>
<p>Packt is entering the video training business in 2012 and we are planning to develop a screencast  on "Sencha Touch Mobile Framework" and am now looking for an author to produce this video on the above title. This course is ideal for anyone who wants to gain the practical knowledge involved in using Sencha Touch mobile web application framework to make attractive web apps for mobiles. If you have some familiarity with HTML and CSS, then this course is for you. This course will give designers the skills they need to implement their ideas, and provide developers with creative inspiration through practical examples. It is assumed that you know how to use touch screens, touch events, WebKit on mobile systems, Apple iOS, and Google Android for Mobiles.</p>
<p>We believe that video training represents an even greater opportunity than books. As with books we will pay an advance and royalty for authors working on video training.<br />
Please contact me if you are interested in producing an e-learning video for this title and I would love to discuss the opportunity with you further.<br />

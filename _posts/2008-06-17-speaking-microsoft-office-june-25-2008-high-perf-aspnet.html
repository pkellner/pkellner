<h2>Building High performance ASP.NET web applications - In this meeting, Peter Kellner will present on and discuss techniques and methodologies for developing highly performant and scalable web sites. </h2>
<p>Topics will&#160; include appropriate use of Cache and Session State, as well as how and when to use them.&#160; Viewstate management and methods to minimize its use will be discussed.&#160; Code to pop up a warning when a threshold is met in development will be shown.&#160; When and how to take advantage of Server Farms will be discussed, as well as trouble shooting techniques to find problems. The evils of Server Affinity,&#160; as well as a common pattern for caching database queries will be shown to be wrong.&#160; Time permitting, we will talk about using Microsoft's Ajax.asp.net with UpdatePanel and webservices and how these affect performance and scalability.</p>

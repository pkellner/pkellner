<p>Hi Peter.</p>
<p>I saw your post in the MSDN forums regarding microsoft sync framework and the ability to query on the custom metadata.  You had linked a blog post which is no longer active.<br />
http://connectionroad.com/synchronization-technology/246/how-to-get-metadata-from-the-microsoft-sync-framework-file-provider/</p>
<p>I'm trying to figure out the same thing..i'm storing some custom metadata in the metadatastore and now want to query it.  Can you provide some hints.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />

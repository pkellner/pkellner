<p>Yesterday, I spent the day building what I think are stantions (piles of blocks held together by mortar) to hold a house 5 feet above the ground.&#160; Through twitter, I saw a bunch of people from all over the country that were going to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/techednorthamerica/">TechEd 2010</a> in New Orleans a day early to help in a Habitat for Humanity project.&#160; The group had created a web page called <a title="http://geekgive.org/Charity/habitat" href="http://geekgive.org/Charity/habitat">http://geekgive.org/Charity/habitat</a>.&#160; I’ve always wanted to help on one of those type projects but never really figured out how to.&#160; This seemed like the perfect opportunity, and also, since some of my friends from around the country would be there also, I thought it would be a great time to catch up.&#160; What a great time and a great feeling to help.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, New Orleans was devastated after the kill hurricane went through.&#160; Many houses were just totally demolished.&#160; These <a href="http://www.habitat.org/">Habitat for Humanity</a> houses are designed to sit 5 feet above the ground on steel re-enforced concrete blocks.&#160; They can withstand 125 MPH steady winds with 200 MPH gusts.</p>

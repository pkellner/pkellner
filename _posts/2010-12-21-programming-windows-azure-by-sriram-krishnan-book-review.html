<p>I’ve been slowly building up my <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/">Azure</a> experience over the past few months and actually plan to release a product using Azure during the next month or two.&#160; Programming Windows Azure has been a huge value to me in learning both the basics of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/">Azure</a> platform as well as the details.&#160; It has a great balance of theory verses practice.&#160; I strongly recommend this book if you are new to Azure or even if you have experience with Azure.&#160; I often find myself going back and re-reading sections to better understand things.</p>

<p>Two of the sections I feel are particularly well written or the ones that talk about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd179355.aspx">Storage and Tables</a> (chapters 7 and 8).&#160; The application I’ve been working on heavily uses blob storage and I spend lots of times re-reading those sections.&#160; Azure tables is a hard topic to get a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/default.aspx">sql server</a> programmer like me to get my head wrapped around.&#160; Sriram does a great job of talking directly to someone like me to help me understand how and when to use tables.</p>
<p>Again, I whole heartedly recommend this book.</p>

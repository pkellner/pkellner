<p>Windows Powershell is something I've been meaning to learn for quite some time.&#160; It started out as the Monad Project at Microsoft and I remember seeing it discussed at Code Camps but never spending the time to go.&#160; I thought it was just another command.com with special commands.</p>
<p>Turns out, I was very wrong.&#160; As far as I'm concerned, it's strength is that you can reference .net assemblies directly.&#160; That means, you can access everything in .Net just like a first class language.&#160; Be that C# or VB, you can get to all of it.&#160; You can write your own assemblies and reference them as well!&#160; It of course if fully object oriented, very rich, and full error handling.&#160; Very cool</p>

<p>So, back to the book.&#160; Bruce Payett does a great job of introducing Windows Power Shell (aka Monad) and taking you step by step through the process of using it.&#160; He has lots of great examples and the book, as you would expect from a Manning book, is well indexed and well illustrated.&#160; I highly recommend getting it if you have not used Power Shell before.</p>

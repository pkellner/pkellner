excerpt: This article introduces React with Next.js and server components, detailing their benefits and implementation. It covers how server components enable reduced bundle sizes and improved performance, and how Next.js complements React by offering features like automatic routing, server rendering, and static site generation. The post also provides step-by-step setup instructions and examples.

NextJS 13 and Server Components: A Deep Dive with Examples
==========================================================

In this article, we'll explore how NextJS 13 works with server components, a major addition to the React ecosystem. We'll also provide an example of fetching data from the placeholder API using async components. Before diving into the details, let's take a brief walk down memory lane and see how server components came to be.

A Brief History of Server Components
------------------------------------

Server components have a long history in the React ecosystem, dating back to 2014. The React team, at Facebook, was working on improving performance and making it easier to build modern user interfaces. They introduced server-side rendering as a way to offload part of the rendering process to the server, thereby improving the initial loading time of a page.

Over the years, the React community came up with various approaches to enhance server-side rendering, such as using Node.js as a rendering engine or employing third-party libraries like NextJS. NextJS, in particular, has always been at the forefront of server-rendered React applications, offering a smooth developer experience and excellent performance.

With the advent of NextJS 13, we now have a powerful way to use server components, which brings improved performance and better separation of concerns to our applications.

NextJS 13 and Server Components
-------------------------------

NextJS 13 has added support for React Server Components, a new feature that allows developers to write components that run on the server and send only the HTML and minimal JavaScript to the client. This results in faster loading times, reduced client-side JavaScript, and a more performant application overall.

With NextJS 13, the old `.server.js` convention is no longer used. Instead, we'll be taking advantage of async components and the `fetch` API.

Fetching Data with Async Components and the Placeholder API
-----------------------------------------------------------

Now let's look at an example of fetching data from the placeholder API using async components. We'll use the `fetch` API, as it's supported natively by modern browsers and does not require any polyfills.

```jsx
// components/PlaceholderData.server.jsx
import React from 'react';

async function fetchPlaceholderData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

export default async function PlaceholderData() {
  
  const fetchedData = await fetchPlaceholderData();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{data.title}</h3>
      <p>{data.body}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

```

In this example, we create a server component called `PlaceholderData`. We use the `fetch` API to fetch data from the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and use React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to store and manage the fetched data.

To use this server component in a NextJS page, we simply need to import and use it:

```jsx
// pages/index.js
import React from 'react';
import PlaceholderData from '../components/PlaceholderData.server';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to our NextJS 13 App!</h1>
      <PlaceholderData />
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;
```

In this setup, the `PlaceholderData` component will be rendered on the server, and only the necessary HTML and JavaScript will be sent to the client, making our application faster and more efficient.

  return data;
}

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const data = await fetchPlaceholderData();
  return { props: { data } };
}

export default function PlaceholderData({ data }) {
  if (!data) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{data.title}</h3>
      <p>{data.body}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we create a server component called `PlaceholderData`. We use the `fetch` API to fetch data from the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and the `getServerSideProps` function to fetch the data on the server side.

To use this server component in a NextJS page, we simply need to import and use it:

```jsx
// pages/index.js
import React from 'react';
import PlaceholderData from '../components/PlaceholderData.server';

function HomePage({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to our NextJS 13 App!</h1>
      <PlaceholderData data={data} />
    </div>
  );
}

export { getServerSideProps } from '../components/PlaceholderData.server';

export default HomePage;
```

In this setup, the `PlaceholderData` component will be rendered on the server, and only the necessary HTML and JavaScript will be sent to the client, making our application faster and more efficient.

Often, we find ourselves in a situation where we've coded with [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) and we want more capability integrated into our change.  That is, we may want to add a logging statement that outputs the original value and the changed value, or even store that change someplace as history. useReducer is perfect for this, but as it's parameters feel quite different. Luckily, since useState is actually built with [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer), it is very possible to make this conversion.

I just joined Mastodon with the account <a rel="me" href="https://techhub.social/@pkellner">@pkellner@techhub.social</a>. So far it's looking good. A lot more to learn about it.

I hope it's better than twitter now that twitter is becoming a dumpster fire.

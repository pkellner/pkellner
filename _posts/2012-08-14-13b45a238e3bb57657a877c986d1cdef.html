<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I am working on a web application for my intern on which the web forms are needed to be connected and used to a SQL Server database. on my one of the form, I would need to change a text properties of a label when the text properties of a dropdown list is changed. meaning when I select different value, the label that shows the ID property of the selected value needs to be changed and shown, I think this can be done by JScript but I am not sure. I am wondering, if you could possibly help me with this problem, I would really appreciate.</p>

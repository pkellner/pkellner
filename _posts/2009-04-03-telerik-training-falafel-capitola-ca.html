<p><a href="http://www.falafel.com/Default.aspx">Falafel Software</a> is putting a three day training course in their new training facility in Capitola from Monday to Wednesday April 13-15th.&#160; As many of you know, I've used Telerik control in many projects and have blogged extensively about my experiences.&#160; The control toolkit is hugely rich and very well written.&#160; Personally, I never had the chance to do a training class and managed to learn the toolkit on my own.&#160; This seems like an awesome opportunity to learn from one of <a href="http://www.telerik.com/">Telerik's</a> best partners.&#160; I hope you can make it!</p>

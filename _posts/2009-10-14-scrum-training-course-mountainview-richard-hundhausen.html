<p>Several years ago, I was invited to a special showing of what was going to be the new SqlServer 2008 database in San Francisco.&#160; I had expected a sales demo but was hugely surprised by the quality of the presenter and his deep understanding of issues facing real developers like us.&#160; Over the years, I’ve gotten to know this presenter (<a href="http://blog.hundhausen.com/">Richard Hundhausen</a>) and the other work he’s been involved in. </p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>Richard has been developing a special training course for the Scrum development team.&#160; He’s giving this course called “Scrum Developer Training” at the Microsoft Technology Center in just a few weeks (11/2-11/6).&#160; If you have the opportunity, I can’t imagine a better thing to do to help improve you skills at being productive working in an engineering team.&#160; You can register at the following URL: </p>

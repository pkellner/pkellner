<h2>My 5 Things</h2>
<p><strong>Been Tagged! Thanks </strong><a href="http://blog.hundhausen.com/">     <br /><strong>Richard</strong></a><strong>. So, here are 5 things about me you don't     <br />already know (maybe).</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.&#160; I don't color my hair </strong></p>
<p>(OK, you probably knew that so I won't count this but needed it to start the thought process)</p>
<p><strong>1.&#160; I started my career as a rocket scientist.</strong></p>
<p>My first 4 years after college I worked for Lockheed Missiles and Space System.&#160; Actually, I think this was the most fun part of my career. We had totally cool toys to play with.&#160; Lots of freedom to do whatever we wanted (OK, as long as it was a missile or space system), and to top it off, I had a wonderful group I was a part of.&#160; A totally awesome job.&#160; Had our contract from the government not been cancelled, then the following 4 proposals shot down, I would probably still be there.&#160; In hind sight, maybe we should have been doing a little less of anything we wanted and more of was   <br />was necessary.</p>

<p><strong>2.&#160; I played the violin for 5 years (OK, sort of)</strong></p>
<p>My mom says it was my idea, but I'm sure I was thinking of a guitar. Oh well, will never know.&#160; I finally rebelled when I was 14.&#160; Thank goodness. I took 2 lessons a week at the very famous Hoff Barthelson Music school in Scarsdale, New York.&#160; My maternal grandmother was paying for these lessons and stopping was tantamount to a full scale rebellion.</p>
<p><strong>3.&#160; I ran my College Fraternities initiation when I was a senior at Cornell University.</strong>&#160;</p>
<p>We had a particularly nasty initiation that I always resented.&#160; When I was a senior, I decided the best way to influence and make it more fun was to run it.&#160; At one point I had to tell one of the &quot;Brothers&quot; that he had a choice.&#160; He could stop doing what he was doing, or I was going to call the police and they would tell him to stop doing what he was doing. </p>
<p><strong>4.&#160; I love bike riding. </strong>&#160;</p>
<p>OK, I talk about in my bio as well as every other time someone will listen so I won't count this one either.&#160; (<a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/petertammyxride.jpg">My     <br />Wife Tammy and I completing our cross country ride in 2003, very happy</a>)</p>
<p><strong>4.&#160; Born to Schmooze (but Not very smart about it)</strong></p>
<p>The business that I ran from about 1985 to 2000 was primarily about selling computer systems to eye doctors.&#160; I early on figured out that it was a word of mouth type sale so I learned to get involved in all the social circles of eye doctors that I could.&#160; By the time I retired from this business, I had a majority of the board of directors of the American Optometric Association using my system.&#160; I would often attend the private in room parties at the big conventions of just the ruling elite.&#160; I never really had to be invited, I just always seemed to know where these parties were.&#160; I later found out that most of the people I knew from these parties thought I was an eye doctor, and not a computer salesman in sheep's clothing.&#160; Oh well, maybe in my next career (whatever that is) I will be smarter.</p>
<p><strong>5.&#160; I ride a unicycle (maybe not anymore)</strong></p>
<p>OK, one more biking thing.&#160; When I was about 10, I was driving home from New York City with my parents from visiting my grandmother's house on 73rd Street.&#160; We passed a guy riding a unicyle on 5th avenue.&#160; I thought that was totally cool.&#160; For the next 3 months I demanded a unicyle, and after my parents finally gave in they bought me one.&#160; for the 3 months after that, I spent crashing down a narrow a hall way in our basement until I finally learned how to ride the darn thing.&#160; My mom has finally put pictures back up in the hall way.&#160; While I was learning I stripped both the   <br />left and right walls of all pictures as well as I am sure denting the very hard tile floor.</p>

<p>I guess I'm supposed to tag some others.&#160; Everyone I know but   <br /><a href="http://nimad.wordpress.com/">Nima Dilmaghani</a>,    <br /><a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/tlacey/">Trisha Lacey </a> and    <br /><a href="http://blog.untangle.com/?cat=1">Dirk Morris</a> have already been    <br />tagged so ... ( a    <br /><a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/trishanima.jpg">picture</a> is    <br />worth a thousand words, from <a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/">     <br />codecamp</a>)</p>

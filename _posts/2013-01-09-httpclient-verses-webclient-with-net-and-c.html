<p>I often find I do what I know over and over again and don’t look for new solutions if the old tried and true solution works.&#160; At my last hackathon, I wrote an app the screen scraped the starbucks site.&#160; I noticed when I looked at the site that a redirect happened after sign in.&#160; My WebClient call did not follow the redirect.&#160; I asked for help from a very bright Microsoft Azure guy (<a href="https://twitter.com/joshtwist">Josh Twist</a>) who blogs at <a title="http://www.thejoyofcode.com/About_us.aspx" href="http://www.thejoyofcode.com/About_us.aspx">http://www.thejoyofcode.com/About_us.aspx</a>.&#160; Josh suggested switching to HttpClient and making sure to set the option that follows redirects.</p>
<p>Perfect!&#160; I’m hooked on HttpClient now forever. WebClient is now just in my rear view mirror.</p>

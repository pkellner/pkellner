<p>Hi,<br />
I've registered to volunteer for SVCC tomorrow; and I'm trying to log into the site to verify what jobs I've volunteered for (and just check my schedule.) I forgot my password, and used the forgot password link, but the generated password doesn't work to allow me to log in.  Any ideas what I might be doing wrong?</p>

<p>I’ve been a very happy use of Foxmarks over the years for keeping my bookmarks in <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ie.html">FireFox</a> up to date.&#160; Turns out, they’ve renamed themselves to <a href="http://www.xmarks.com/">xmarks</a> I guess so that people don’t assume they just do Firefox.</p>
<p>Basically, the way it works is you create an account on their server, then for firefox you download a plugin, and for IE you download an extension.&#160; Like magic, your bookmarks just stay in sync!</p>

<p>Another nice things is you can manager your book marks on line.&#160; The Xmarks folks used <a href="http://extjs.com">ExtJS</a> (my favorite JavaScript library to build their interface, and they did a very nice job).</p>
<p>One thing I find a little unusual is it asked for a $5 donation.&#160; I noticed that Mitchell Kapor is the founder (also inventor of Lotus in 1982).&#160; I have trouble believing he needs my $5.</p>

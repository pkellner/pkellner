<p><a href="http://live.visitmix.com/">MIX11</a> In Las Vegas has been a really fun and exciting couple of days.&#160; For me, the sessions are interesting, but my feeling is I can always go back and see them on the internet.&#160; The most interesting things happen during the side conversations with Microsoft Team members and friends I don’t see often.</p>
<p>In this video, I’m having a little Fun with <a href="http://twitter.com/smarx">Steve Marx</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/say_wht">Tina Dawson</a> of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/">Windows Azure Team</a>.&#160; I’m not sure of Tina’s role, but Steve is undoubtedly my best advocate on the Windows Azure team.&#160; Over the past 6 months or so, since I’ve been working building my first major Azure product (Soon to be found at <a href="http://connectionroad.com">http://connectionroad.com</a>), Steve has been an immense help in sorting out tough issues.&#160; Patiently explaining concepts as well as taking my “constructive” feedback to the team for further analysis.</p>

<p>(BTW, just a little background on the wardrobe consulting comment at the beginning.&#160; About a year ago, I discovered, well, maybe someone mentioned to me, that wearing white socks with my dark running shoes and long pants was not exactly a fashion statement.&#160; Noticing Steve in the same condition, obviously landing there as I did, we asked Tina for a consult.&#160; Steve asked Tina if white socks with dark shoes and dark pants were reasonable.&#160; Tina’s response was “Only if you are Michael Jackon”.&#160; Later, she tried to mellow her response however by that point every had heard it her hopes of what is said in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas were totally dashed.)</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>I am reaching out to you regarding a client of mine:  Gizmox. (http://www.visualwebgui.com). Visual WebGUI is their popular open source tool.</p>
<p>I was interested to see if you are involved in any projects that are modernizing and upgrading legacy client server, web and older applications into HTML5-based web and mobile applications. </p>
<p>Gizmox provides tools that automate the modernization and upgrade process for "legacy" Windows applications and extends local applications to native HTML5 Web, Cloud and Mobile deployments - all without costly rewrites and application virtualization. </p>
<p>=&gt; Cost Effective: Typically our costs range between $.35 to $.50 per Line of Code (as compared to $6 - $26 per LOC for a code rewrite).<br />
=&gt; Rapid Execution: In a recent POC we moved 90K LOC from VB6 to .Net in 3 Weeks.  </p>
<p>Gizmox provides an easier way to move and upgrade existing applications, one that reduces migration risk, minimizes costs, and accelerates implementation time.</p>
<p>Please see our white paper here:  (http://www.visualwebgui.com/Gizmox/Resources/WhitePapers/tabid/528/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/1007/Transposition-a-Fresh-Approach-to-Moving-NET-and-VB-60-to-HTML5-Web-Cloud-and-Mobile.aspx).</p>
<p>How about an introductory call?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

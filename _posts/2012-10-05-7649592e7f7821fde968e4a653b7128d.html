<p>Peter, I am sorry but I need to cancel my session at SVCC this year. I was going to give "Scaling QA Beyond a List of Test Cases" however due to personal reasons I have not had the time to prepare adequately. I really enjoyed speaking last year and kept trying to push myself to get ready for this weekend, but reality has set in. I unchecked "speaking" in my profile on the website, but I don't know if there is anything else needed. Feel free to email me at jordan@box.com if there is anything more I need to do<br />

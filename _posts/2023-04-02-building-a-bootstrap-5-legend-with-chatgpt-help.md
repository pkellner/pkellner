excerpt: See the dialog between me (a software dev) talking to ChatGPT to build a simple legend using ChatGPT. As a non bootstrap wizard, this only took me about 2 minutes in total and I got a very impressive legend built in Bootstrap 4 as a React / TypeScript component.

# Introduction

Lately, my mind has been 100% expanded by what ChatGPT can do to help me with my programming tasks. Especially tasks where I don't consider myself an expert, and I need some help. This morning, as I'm working on the demo for an upcoming course titled "Server Component Fundamentals in React 18" for Pluralsight, I decided I needed a legend. Normally I don't do a wireframe for something so simple, but since I know you are not in my head, this is what I was thinking.

So, I go to the <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" target="_blank">ChatGPT web site</a> and start asking for help. Literally, after only about 2 or 3 minutes and a conversation with ChatGPT, here is the resulting React component displayed, as well as the code I got generated by ChatGPT with no changes from me.

```JavaScript
import React, { useState } from "react";

type LegendProps = {
  legendTitle: string;
};

function Legend({ legendTitle }: LegendProps) {
  const [reactServer, setReactServer] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [reactClient, setReactClient] = useState<boolean>(false);

  const legendStyle: React.CSSProperties = {
    border: "1px solid #ccc",
    borderRadius: "5px",
    padding: "20px",
    backgroundColor: "#eee",
  };

  const checkboxStyle: React.CSSProperties = {
    marginBottom: "10px",
  };

  return (
    <div style={legendStyle}>
      <h4 style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>{legendTitle}</h4>
      <div className="form-check" style={checkboxStyle}>
        <input
          className="form-check-input"
          type="checkbox"
          id="reactServer"
          checked={reactServer}
          onChange={() => setReactServer(!reactServer)}
        />
        <label
          className="form-check-label"
          htmlFor="reactServer"
          style={{ color: "blue" }}
        >
          React Server Components
        </label>
      </div>
      <div className="form-check" style={checkboxStyle}>
        <input
          className="form-check-input"
          type="checkbox"
          id="reactClient"
          checked={reactClient}
          onChange={() => setReactClient(!reactClient)}
        />
        <label
          className="form-check-label"
          htmlFor="reactClient"
          style={{ color: "green" }}
        >
          React Client Components
        </label>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ backgroundColor: "#ddd", padding: "20px" }}>
      <Legend legendTitle="Display Options for Server and Client Components" />
    </div>
  );
}

```

# The ChatGPT Conversation

So, what questions did I ask ChatGPT to get this?  Below are the questions I asked but without the intervening answers from ChatGPT that led me to ask each question in order.  Further down in this article you can look at the full conversation from my web session.

## Create a legend in bootstrap 5 that includes checkboxes for two items, each indifferent colors

## Put the handlers inline

## Put a nice border around the legend

## Change the names of the variables for the checkboxes to showRsc and showRcc

## Make this with typescript

## Update usestate for typescript also

## Add a title to the legend saying "Display Options for Server and Client Components"

## Add some padding around the legend as well as the contents and make the background gray

## Rename variables rsc and rcc to React Server Components and React Client Components

Just 2 minutes of Q&A

# Conclusions

ChatGPT and AI tools like this will change my programming forever. I doubt I'll use Google search nearly as much, I won't look on StackOverflow for answers as often, and in general, it will make me a better programmer.

Years ago, when car navigators became a thing, I had a good friend I'd call and ask for help when I'd get lost driving around. She's always help me, as she seem to know every street in my city.  After a while I stopped calling her and she asked me one day why. I said that I'd replaced her with a Garmin navigation device that helped me get places, and when I made mistakes, it corrected them with no judgement (and yes, she's still my friend).

I decided to see what I'd generated so copied it into a React project and viewed the results.

And again, the final product.

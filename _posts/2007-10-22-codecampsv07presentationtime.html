<h2>I'm Speaking at Silicon Valley Code Camp on Silverlight</h2>
<h3>Sunday at 1:15PM, October 27th. Foothill College</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com">     <br />http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com</a></p>
<p>This coming Sunday, October 27th at 1:15PM, I'm giving a presentation about a Silverlight application I developed for Microsoft and Leverage Software.&#160; It will be a pretty technical session on all the things I learned and the tricks I had to use to make things work.&#160; The session can be found <a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Sessions.aspx?OnlyOne=true&amp;amp;id=125">here</a>.</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>I worked very closely with a very talented designer (Uday Gajendar) who is also doing a session after mine titled &quot;<a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Sessions.aspx?OnlyOne=true&amp;id=160">Life     <br />on the Other Side: A UI Designer's story</a>&quot;.&#160; I plan on going to that one also.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

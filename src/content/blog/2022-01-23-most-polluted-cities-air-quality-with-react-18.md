# Notes About React 18 App

This app was written from the group up using the release candidate for React 18.  It uses all the latest features including Suspense that have been introduced in React 18.

It also takes advantage of the Context API as well as fallback processing for Errors and Suspense components before promises are completed.

Enjoy!

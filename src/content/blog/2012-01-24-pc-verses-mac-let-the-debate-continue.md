<p>So, I know it’s hard to believe, but I am actually considering getting a Macbook to use as my main development computer.&#160; The reason is I’m using some beta mobile development tools that only support the Mac.&#160; The problem is that if I don’t use these tools and incrementally build my app with them, I will get my app far out of wac (wac being a technical term) that I will never be able to get it back in wac again.&#160; </p>
<p>So, I have a good friend who is a Mac wizard and I thought I’d ask him a question.&#160; Below is my question and his answer.&#160; Keep in mind, my friend is very technical in the Mac world.</p>
<p>Question from me (PC Guy):</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve been trying to figure that out for myself which Mac model to get.&#160; If I get one, I want SandyBridge or later.&#160; I think that’s quad core, but hard to tell.&#160; Apple just seems to give dates on the refurbished site for their computers.&#160; It’s also good to know they work with 16gb ram.&#160; I need that because I run big fat windows VM’s.&#160; The other thing I can’t quite figure out is if the 15’s support 2 drives internally if you are willing to forego the optical drive.&#160; I like to run the boot drive as SSD (SATA3) and the secondary drive as just a normal SATA2 or SATA3.</p>

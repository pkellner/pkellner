<p>In this post, I’m going to simply document the process of updating my MIcrosoft Office 2007.&#160; As almost anyone knows who has not been hiding under a rock, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/2010/en/default.aspx">Microsoft Office 2010</a> has been in the works for quite a while.&#160; I know there are several launch events and formal release events coming up so I don’t mean to imply you can buy it now.&#160; If you are on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">MSDN</a> (Microsoft’s developer network) I believe you should be able to download it now.</p>
<p>You can read about the changes here:&#160; <a title="http://blogs.technet.com/office2010/" href="http://blogs.technet.com/office2010/">http://blogs.technet.com/office2010/</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>I just downloaded the latest office 2010 professional from MSDN.&#160; First thing I notice is that there are now two versions.&#160; A 64bit and a 32bit.&#160; Thinking bigger is better, I of course elected to download the 64 bit and install that.&#160; It’s nice that it is an exe file so I can run it without first having to mount it as an iso.&#160; When I do run it, it tells me that I can not upgrade my existing 32bit version and will have to uninstall and reinstall from scratch to do that.&#160; My thinking is now that maybe 64bit is not that important to me so I grab the 32 bit version and am installing now.</p>

<p>I’m running a Lenovo W500 with 8Gig of RAM and a solid state drive.&#160; It takes about 10 minutes to run the update.&#160; The only part of the upgrade I’m concerned about is my hosted Exchange.&#160; I’ve got about 2 gig of mail synchronized with the exchange server so I’d prefer not to have to start again.&#160; Let’s see how this works out for me.&#160; I’m doing this post as I’m doing the upgrade.</p>
<p>… time goes by … </p>
<p><a href="/FilesForWebDownload/UpgradingOffice2007toOffice2010FirstLook_85FD/image_3.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/FilesForWebDownload/UpgradingOffice2007toOffice2010FirstLook_85FD/image_thumb_3.png" width="393" height="325" /></a>&#160;</p>
<p>and then… </p>
<p><a href="/FilesForWebDownload/UpgradingOffice2007toOffice2010FirstLook_85FD/image_4.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/FilesForWebDownload/UpgradingOffice2007toOffice2010FirstLook_85FD/image_thumb_4.png" width="341" height="136" /></a> </p>
<p>(good thing I’m using Microsoft’s LIve Writer and can save this locally)</p>
<p>And, after the reboot, I notice that there is a new Office 2010 on my Start Bar and my quick start from the start button is gone.&#160; Here is the new start menu choices:</p>
<p><a href="/FilesForWebDownload/UpgradingOffice2007toOffice2010FirstLook_85FD/image_5.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/FilesForWebDownload/UpgradingOffice2007toOffice2010FirstLook_85FD/image_thumb_5.png" width="244" height="196" /></a> </p>
<p>Then, when I run Outlook 2010 for the first time:</p>
<p><a href="/FilesForWebDownload/UpgradingOffice2007toOffice2010FirstLook_85FD/image_6.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/FilesForWebDownload/UpgradingOffice2007toOffice2010FirstLook_85FD/image_thumb_6.png" width="278" height="330" /></a> </p>
<p>I put in my credentials, I get the “Outlook is starting for the first time” (not what I was hoping for), and then a warning about outlook not being my default email program (I thought it was, so I’m just going to say yes).</p>
<p>Up comes outlook along with a normal (not unexpected) set of choices.</p>
<p><a href="/FilesForWebDownload/UpgradingOffice2007toOffice2010FirstLook_85FD/image_7.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/FilesForWebDownload/UpgradingOffice2007toOffice2010FirstLook_85FD/image_thumb_7.png" width="476" height="272" /></a> </p>
<p>for which I say “Use Recommended Settings” (because it has the biggest check box next to it :)).</p>
<p>Now, it seems to have worked. All my email is there without having to download which is nice.&#160; It looks a little different.&#160; I guess I’ll know in a little while after doing mail if there is anything that surprises me.</p>
<p><a href="/FilesForWebDownload/UpgradingOffice2007toOffice2010FirstLook_85FD/image_8.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/FilesForWebDownload/UpgradingOffice2007toOffice2010FirstLook_85FD/image_thumb_8.png" width="503" height="295" /></a>&#160;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

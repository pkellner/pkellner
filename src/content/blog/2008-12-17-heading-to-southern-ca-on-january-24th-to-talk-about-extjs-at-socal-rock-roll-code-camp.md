<p>I just signed up to give a session at the <a href="http://www.socalcodecamp.com/default.aspx">SoCal Code Camp at CALSTATE Fullerton</a>.&#160; I've been to this event before and it's totally awesome.&#160; Those SoCal guys really know how to throw a camp.&#160; If you're from around there, please stop by and see me.&#160; It's going to be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>My Session which covers some basics of <a href="http://extjs.com/">ExtJS</a> (a rich <a href="http://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a> library) is:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.socalcodecamp.com/session.aspx?sid=33e8ceaf-6812-4310-8070-e54fed099a6d">Build a Rich JavaScript (with ExtJS) Applications for highly interactive Web Pages</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>If you've never seen anything done with pure JavaScript, take a look at the <a href="http://extjs.com/products/extjs/">ExtJS demos</a>.&#160; Very impressive.&#160; Just the demos got me hooked.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing lots of friends there.&#160; BTW, nice job on the new web site!</p>

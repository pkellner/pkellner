<p>Last month, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/synergist/" target="_blank">Michael Scherotter</a>, a Microsoft Developer Evangelist and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/" target="_blank">Silverlight</a> expert did a great 2 day even in San Francisco on Silverlight.&#160; His aim was to focus on designer, but as a developer, I like to see how the other half thinks.&#160; Seemed like about 30 people were there and I'd say everyone got good stuff from it.&#160; I had never met Michael before but have been a regular reader of his blog.&#160; One of the things I really liked was that Mike seemed to have a great handle from both the dev side (like me) and the designer side.&#160;&#160;&#160; His focus was around <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/Overview.aspx?key=blend" target="_blank">Expression Blend 2.5</a> Turns out he is an real architect (builds buildings not code) by training and from what I know, that brings a discipline into design that is similar to the way us Dev's think.</p>

<p>If he ever does this again, I highly recommend you go if you can.</p>

<p>I know this seems kind of trivial but I just accidentally discovered a feature in Visual Studio that probably all in all has cost me many many lost seconds of productivity.  I often find myself in visual studio with something in my paste buffer but want to search for something else in code. I know this sounds a little obtuse but if you know what I’m talking about and you don’t do it yourself, this will save you a bunch of time.</p>
<p>I’m in  them middle of full speed prep for <a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/" target="_blank">Silicon Valley Code Camp</a> (which is what this program I am using for the example below is) as well as working on my next Sencha ExtJS 5 upgrade Plurasight video so I have my tools all cranked up. I thought I’d quickly share a video of what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>Here you go!</p>

<p>Just a quick shout out to the makers of <a href="http://www.cerebrata.com/?r=CSSV2010.11.09.00">Cloud Storage Studio Cerebrate Software</a>.&#160;&#160; Thanks for a great product offering!&#160; I’ve been doing quite a bit of work recently with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/windowsazure/">Microsoft Windows Azure</a> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd135733.aspx">Blob Storage</a> and have really appreciated the insight into that storage Cloud Studio gives me.&#160; I had been using another product to do the same thing which I had though was easier and faster, but after just a couple hours of working with Cloud Studio, I’m finding I’ve really been missing out.&#160; </p>
<p>I’m attaching a screen shot below which shows viewing what is actually in the storage (not a hierarchical false view) as well as a display of all the meta data.&#160; Either of those two features are show starters for me and enough to switch.</p>

<p>If you have not used it, give it&#160; try (and have some patience, it takes a little bit of practice to find the true value).</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

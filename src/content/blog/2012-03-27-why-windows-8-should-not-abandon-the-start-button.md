<p>I don’t often post my opinions on contention issues, however I think in this case, it is more than necessary and appropriate.&#160; Unlike <a href="http://www.bing.com/news/search?q=start+button+windows+8&amp;qpvt=start+button+windows+8&amp;FORM=EWRE">most people</a> who have been publishing there opinions lately, I’ve actually been using <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/consumer-preview">Windows 8</a> as my primary operating system now since February 29th when the latest preview was released.&#160; I’ve been to the <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">BUILD</a> conference, I’ve watched many of the videos and to a reasonable degree, my opinion is validated with real experience.</p>
<p>Those in favor of eliminating the <a href="http://www.bing.com/news/search?q=start+button+windows+8&amp;qpvt=start+button+windows+8&amp;FORM=EWRE">start button</a> simply say Metro is simply the equivalent of the start button and you should use it the same way.&#160; I could not disagree more.&#160; When you are running in Metro the apps look different, you task switch them differently, just everything about them is different.&#160; To those that say you don’t need a start button, I would say then you should say just as much you don’t need a desktop either.</p>
<p>To Microsoft I say you should give people these two choices (or give them both on the same machine is fine with me also, but don’t mix them up).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><font size="4">1.&#160; Desktop With Start button</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">2.&#160; Metro With No Desktop App</font></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are clearly two separate worlds.&#160; Microsoft, please, don’t make us run them both at the same time.&#160; If I want to run my Windows 8 tablet, I’m 100% happy having Metro&#160; as the only OS.&#160; The start button gives a really miserable experience on a touch device.&#160; Likewise, if I’m on my desktop, please let me avoid Metro and just use the desktop complete with the start button which does work well.&#160; The flashing back and forth to metro is very disconcerting.&#160; As a workaround, I’ve been slowly adding everything I use to my start bar which seems kind of silly.</p>
<p>My 2 cents</p>

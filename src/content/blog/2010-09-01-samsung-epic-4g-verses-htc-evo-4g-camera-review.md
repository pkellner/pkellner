<p>First, let me say I’m not a professional photographer or even a good amateur one, but I do take a lot of pictures.&#160; You can look up the spec on line, but basically, the <a href="http://now.sprint.com/epic4g/?ECID=vanity:epic4g">Epic</a> has a 5MP camera and the <a href="http://now.sprint.com/firsts/evo4g/">EVO</a> has an 8MP pixel.&#160; I wish I kept some originals from the EVO but I did not.&#160; </p>
<p>My impression is that the EVO camera did a better job of making pictures in all kinds of light just look better.&#160; I could be wrong.&#160; I’m attaching a picture of a friend of mine I took and uploaded to facebook, first with the EVO, then with the Epic.&#160; The EVO was taken later in the day without so much sunlight.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>By the way, my friend Terry is President of Undiscovered Country Tours and one of my best bike buddies.&#160; He runs <a href="http://www.udctours.com/">awesome bike trips in California!</a>&#160; You can find his site here:&#160; <a title="http://www.udctours.com/" href="http://www.udctours.com/">http://www.udctours.com/</a>.&#160; If you are looking tour in California, you won’t regret it!</p>

<h2>Samsung Epic 4G</h2>
<p><a href="/FilesForWebDownload/SprintSamsungEpic4GVersesHTCEVO4GCamera_113D8/epic.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="epic" border="0" alt="epic" src="/FilesForWebDownload/SprintSamsungEpic4GVersesHTCEVO4GCamera_113D8/epic_thumb.png" width="484" height="644" /></a> </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I realize the pictures are no where near original size, but just to add some more detail, on the Epic, I had to overexpose the picture as much as I could and it still was a little dark.&#160; The EVO just seemed to work with no mucking around.</p>
<p>Also, for a more detailed review, check out here: <a title="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-epic-4g-vs-htc-evo-4g/" href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-epic-4g-vs-htc-evo-4g/">http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-epic-4g-vs-htc-evo-4g/</a>.&#160; They agree for some real reasons that the HTC EVO 4G Camera is better.&#160; I actually just read this (after I wrote the above) and they totally agree with me.&#160; Here is their quote: “Our test shots showed the Epic returning overly dark outdoor shots in comparison to the EVO 4G, even though they come closer to parity indoors”.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

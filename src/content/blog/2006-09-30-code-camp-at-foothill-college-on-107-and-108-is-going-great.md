<p>As many of you know, I've been organizing CodeCamp here in Silicon Valley (Northern California) for the past month or so.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com">http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com</a></p>
<p>We have over 40 sessions signed up now and closing in on 700 attendees!   Yee ha, this is getting fun.  Please visit the site and if you have any feedback, please send it to me through the contact me page on this blog.  Included in the 14 class rooms that are available to us, we plan on using 5 that are fully equipped with internet connected PC's.  Through these PC's, I expect people to be constantly checking the schedules and adding feedback to classes they are attending.  I'm currently having some trouble with printing the schedule through the sessions page, buth hopefully some one will come to my rescue soon on that.</p>
<p>I've been busy running SqlServer Tracing to Cache every database access I can possibly cache.   The sessions page, which touches almost every table, does not create one database hit once the data is cached.   My ISP (ultimate hosting) assures me we have a beefy server at the other end of the pipe.  It's a college campus on a weekend so the pipe from codecamp will be wide open.  Hopefully all my hard work will run well when put to the test.</p>
<p>Wish us luck</p>

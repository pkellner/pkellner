<p> OK, so we all want to be somewhat popular, and it seems that my last article, <a href="/2009/10/19/codingstandards-csharp-braces/">“To Brace Or Not to Brace”,</a> seems to have gotten a lot of attention, so, here goes my opinion on the popular semi-colon argument.&#160; First, I’m not against any languages in particular, but I have found that I do better in ones that have semi-colons.&#160; One of the features I really like is the ability to move my line returns anyplace I want, and to indent as I see fit.&#160; Though the semi-colon does not guarantee I can do this, it certainly makes life easier.</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>So, what’s wrong with using tabs to signal nesting levels and dispense with semi-colons?&#160; Well, for me, that is just too hard.&#160; I always seem to mess up and my code stops working.&#160; What about line continuations?&#160; I just have to ask why?&#160; Want to continue, just press the return key.&#160; Not much else to remember.</p>
<p>In College, I learned a language called PL/1 (long forgotten) that required semi-colons.&#160; I remember the compiler would constantly spit out errors saying “Maybe you have missed your semi-colon?”.&#160; I use to find that very annoying, but now, that I’m a semicolon lover, I just happily type them at the end of each statement I want terminated.</p>
<p>There are dissenters however.&#160; For example, the TheMightyFavog says <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=105x6098021">“Let’s get rid of it.&#160; Nobody knows how to use the thing anyway</a>”. </p>
<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

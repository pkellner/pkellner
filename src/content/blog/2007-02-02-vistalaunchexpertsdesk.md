<p>Microsoft asked me to help out at the Launch event here near my home in San Jose, California. My job, was to hang out      <br />at the &quot;Ask The Experts&quot; community table and answer people's questions. Unfortunately, most people's questions were       <br />on subjects I didn't know much about but I did my best and tried to point them at resources that might help solve       <br />there problems. Several people asked me what I thought of Exchange 2007. I guess since I've never actually run it I       <br />couldn't give much of an opinion.</p>
<p>There were however some interesting asp.net questions that came up that hopefully I fielded pretty well. Other than that, it was      <br />fun to see some local buddies.</p>

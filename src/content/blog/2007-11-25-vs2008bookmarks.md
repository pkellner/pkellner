<p>I noticed that when I set book marks in vs2008, it seemed to work when I set them, but when I cleared them, no joy!. Not being the smartest pencil in the jar, I did this over and over again thinking that my typing muscle memory was just failing me. Surely, something as simple as setting a bookmark could not have changed between versions! Next thing, control dot will not bring up the list of namespaces for an undefined function! (thankfully, that is not the case).</p>
<p>So, after finally realizing my finger muscle memory was not failing me on every bookmark set, I went to the menu command to see. It turns out that setting a bookmark is now control-b T (for toggle) and clearing bookmarks is control-b C (for clear). I'm blogging this in the hopes I can remember it in the future.</p>
<p>Continuing to enjoy vs2008 and the surprises right along the way.</p>

<p>Yesterday, one of my friends who is still using XP asked me if there were any compelling reasons to switch to Vista.&#160; Well, I've been using Vista for so long, it's hard to remember what I didn't have before.</p>
<p>Today, while searching for email, it occurred to me this is one of those things (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong in the post comments).&#160; I can say &quot;Start / Search as follows:</p>
<p><a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/vista11.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 11px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="vista1" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/vista1-thumb1.jpg" width="148" height="240" /></a></p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>And then, I get the following listing which I've clicked on the tab &quot;E-Mail&quot;.&#160; Notice I also have a nice preview screen to show me the details of the mail.</p>
<p><a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/vista21.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 11px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="vista2" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/vista2-thumb1.jpg" width="454" height="172" /></a></p>
<p>One issue I have noticed (if anyone wants to help me, please comment) is that sometimes I don't get the E-mail preview window.&#160; Not sure why.&#160; Just another puzzle at the moment looking for an answer.</p>
<p>Well, that's it for now.&#160; If I think of other vista features I use often, I'll post again.</p>

<p>I'm presenting a session on Silverlight 1.1 at Silicon Valley Code Camp October 27-28, 2007. this event will be held at Foothill College. If you can make it, please register here:   <br /><a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/AttendeeRegistration.aspx">     <br />http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/AttendeeRegistration.aspx</a></p>
<p>So, you might be wondering, what is a code camp, and what does it cost? Well, it's completely free and completely staffed by volunteers. It's a place you can share your passion for technology with others like yourself, it's a place you can give a presentation on your favorite topic to a receptive audience, as well as go to sessions by others who want to share the knowledge. Typically, there are sessions on all kinds of technologies from Microsoft's latest stuff to Java,   <br />Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and even more obscure technologies. It's basically formatted like a 1 day PDC/Teched/JavaOne style event where sessions are pre arranged and you just choose what interests you. Session sign up closes a week before the event so you know what you'll be in for ahead of time and you can plan.</p>

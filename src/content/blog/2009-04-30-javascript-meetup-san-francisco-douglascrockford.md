<p>My guess is 75 people showed up at Dolores Labs last night for this <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jsmeetup/calendar/10185190/">meetup</a>.&#160; It lasted about two hours and had about 6 great presentations.&#160; <a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/">Douglas Crockford</a> kicked it off with a discussion on upcoming security models around new versions of JavaScript followed by several other presentations that included a Google engineer showing cool Google Labs projects, several JavaScript frameworks and other very cool things.&#160; Dolores Labs is down a small alley where I was sure I was lost.&#160; Marked 83A was a non descript door with two flights of stairs. Then, a roomful of engineers, lots of ethernet connections, beer and pizza.&#160; What else could we ask for.</p>
<p>Below are some fun pictures I took. Not sure if it does justice to the fun that was had.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Matt Humphrey for organizing the event.&#160; Job well done!!!</p>

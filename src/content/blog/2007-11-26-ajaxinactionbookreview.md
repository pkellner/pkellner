<p>I'm basically a back end database kind of guy, but over the past years have been doing more front end web stuff.&#160; Asp.Net has been a huge help for me, and now with Visual Studio 2008 and the JavaScript debugging capabilities, I'm finding doing web stuff is just not so bad.&#160; Many of you know I've written several MSDN articles and one of them was over a year ago on how to add Ajax to my Membership solution (back then it was called Atlas).&#160; The <a title="Third Article Published on MSDN! ASP.NET 2.0, Membership Meets Atlas" href="/2006/08/02/third-article-published-on-msdn-aspnet-20-membership-meets-atlas/">article</a> is still out there though now a little out dated.&#160; In it, I extensively use Alessandro's code he posted on his blog.&#160; My point here is Alessandro keeps up with this stuff, and as it turns out, he wrote an excellent book that's been helping me out.</p>
<p>I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone trying to incorporate Ajax into their asp.net applications.&#160; It's not only got a great introduction, but also goes into lots of useful details for day to day programming.</p>

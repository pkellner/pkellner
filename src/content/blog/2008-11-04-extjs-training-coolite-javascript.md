<p>For my current project, I'm focused on delivering the fastest and best user experience possible for our web site.&#160; To deliver this, it is necessary to really focus on delivering client side code.&#160; After doing a bunch of research, the very clear answer to me is to use a Library called <a href="http://extjs.com/">ExtJS</a> combined with a very nice integration tool suite for the .net called <a href="http://coolite.com/">Coolite</a>. It's basically a very rich interactive JavaScript library that is extremely customizable.&#160; To that end, I'm taking a week training class from <a href="http://extjs.com/">ExtJS</a>.&#160; We've had our first day which has focused on CSS and <a href="http://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a> basics with an eye towards the patterns used in <a href="http://extjs.com/">ExtJS</a>.</p>

<p>For those who know what ExtJS is, I have solved the first mystery and it's only days one.&#160; It seems that that call it EXT (pronounced E-X-T).&#160; Also, if your curious of what ExtJS can do, take a look at the <a href="http://coolite.com/">Coolite Demos</a> here.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of me with some <a href="http://extjs.com/company/">ExtJS folks</a> (Me, Jack Slocom, Abraham Elias and our instructor Aaron Conran).&#160; Abraham (their CEO) and I are both learning ExtJS while Jack and Aaron pretty much invented it.&#160; Hopefully that will change by the end of the week (I mean the part about Abraham and I).</p>

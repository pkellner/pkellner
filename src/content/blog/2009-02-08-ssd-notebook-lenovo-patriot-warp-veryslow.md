<h2>Some Background</h2>
<p>I recently notice on Amazon a discussion thread of about 15 people saying how absolutely wonderful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_drive">SSDs</a> are and how the brought new life to their notebook computers.&#160; Every one of them raved about the magic this brought into their lives.</p>
<p>Well, after checking out the prices and performance, it seems that right now there are two classes of these drives.&#160; It seems there is a first generation drive that performs in the area of 15/40Mbs/sec and ones that perform in the 100/170Mbs/sec.&#160; To put this in perspective, when people refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA">SATA</a>/150 or SATA/300, the 150 and 300 are the Mbs/sec.&#160; With Vista resource manager, you can actually see for yourself how man Mbs/sec you are actually getting.&#160; Below is a screen shot showing that.</p>

<p> <!--more-->
<p>The price point for a 64Gig SSD which performs in the faster category is now about $150.&#160; Off to the computer store I went to get mine.&#160; The one I bought is a Patriot Warp as shown below.</p>

<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>So, I get home and immediately put this new drive in my computer and since I now only have 64Gig for my system ( C ) drive, I need to load Vista Business on my Lenovo W500 from scratch (see description at bottom of page).</p>
<p>Immediately, I noticed it booted faster and shutdown faster.&#160; This in fact was power of suggestion because when I looked at the numbers, it really did not boot much faster.&#160; Here is the comparison.</p>

<p>Well, then things really began to fall apart.&#160; It normally takes me a while to load all my different software programs.&#160; Usually I can work at the same time as I’m installing software (most of my software I have ISO’s for so I don’t need to mess with DVDs).&#160; It usually slows me down, but not too bad.&#160; I quickly found that on this SSD, while software was installing, all I could do was wait.&#160; If I tried to do anything else, the computer just slowed to a crawl.</p>
<p>In disbelief, I kept going down this path thinking it was all my imagination and that things were fine and fast.&#160; I even convinced myself this was normal.&#160; Finally, when installing one of my packages from Microsoft I got a failure.&#160; I decided, since I really needed this software I should see if it’s the SSD drive causing the problem. </p>
<p>Next thing I did was to make an image backup with my favorite software (Acronis, see link below), then restore the SSD data to my WD 7200RPM basic rotating drive.&#160; Well, to my total surprise, everything is now fast again and the Microsoft software actually installed no problem.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wait for the next generation of SSD’s to come out.&#160; This generation just does not work for me.&#160; Thank goodness for 15 day return policies!</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't really know how to evaluate this session. I will have to digest it for awhile. I suspect there is huge value hidden just beyond the horizon of my understanding. </li>
<li>Really enjoyed this. This was the talk that I had marked on my schedule from early on. Well done. A bit soft spoken in the begining. </li>
<li>I was 5 or so minutes late for this session - so my difficulties might well have been due to that. I had trouble at first following what was going on. In the end, I think Peter did a great job of limiting the material he presented, and of fleshing out and motivating the material he chose. I will definitely be able to give it a go at creating my own ODS as a result of this talk. Nice job! </li>
<li>started in low key - one of the rare speaker one see how he thinks and can explain - NOT monkey see MONKEY do- MUST be pedagog in his real life - but at the end we had solid understanding of ObjectDataSource. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Portland Code Camp - May 30, 2009 at Reed College</strong></p>
<h3>Building asp.net Membership with ExtJS (Super Rich JavaScript Library)</h3>
<p>JavaScript | extjs | ASP.NET</p>
<p>In this session, we will demonstrate building a super rich JavaScript interface to the standard ASP.NET Membership and Profile services. That is, built into ASP.NET are wonderful providers that allow you to validate and store user credentials typically to a database. It also lets you store other information such as pictures, first and last names, as well as anything else you may want to store. In this session we will build a highly performing, 100% JavaScript UI to maintain hundreds of thousands of users. As part of this solution, techniques for using REST based services to access this information will be presented. Once you see this, it will be hard to ever use web forms again.</p>

<p><strong>Rock And Roll Code Camp in Los Angeles Presentation</strong></p>
<p>This is the first time I've presented this material. I've presented on several previous occassions the basic    <br />material on how to build an ObjectDataSource class from scratch but this time was different. Inspired by people     <br />often asking me &quot;what good is the ObjectDataSource&quot;, I decided to create a useful example. Since the ObjectDataSource is inherently a complex abstraction, creating a real life demo that can be presented in a short amount of time is a challenge. In this presntation, I hopefully rose to the challenge. Below is the abstract along with the URL to the actual codecamp. Below that is a link to the project that was created at class for     <br />anyone interested in seeing the material.</p>

<p>And, Here is the Project Files.&#160; it includes all the .nettiers created code also.&#160; Not easy to build, but you will get the idea.&#160; The project to look at in specific would be the one named: JustODSWeb.&#160; All the others are just .NetTiers support.   <br /><a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/CodeCampJan07LA.zip">     <br />https://peterkellner.net/DownLoads/CodeCampJan07LA.zip</a></p>

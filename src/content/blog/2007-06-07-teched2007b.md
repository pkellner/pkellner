  Today, Noah, one of my Microsoft hero&#39;s in devland presented products from his
  groups today.&nbsp; I&#39;ve always been a big fan of performance analysis as well
  as unit testing and code analysis.&nbsp; The integration just keeps getting
  better.&nbsp; Now, for example, you can right click on a method name and say
  &quot;Generate a unit test&quot;.&nbsp; You can also right click on a unit test and say
  &quot;Give me a performance metric&quot;.&nbsp; Very cool.

<p>Today, Noah, one of my Microsoft hero's in devland presented products from his&#160; groups today.&#160; I've always been a big fan of performance analysis as well&#160; as unit testing and code analysis.&#160; The integration just keeps getting&#160; better.&#160; Now, for example, you can right click on a method name and say&#160; &quot;Generate a unit test&quot;.&#160; You can also right click on a unit test and say&#160; &quot;Give me a performance metric&quot;.&#160; Very cool.</p>

<p>One thing I need to mention is that there was a guy sitting behind me with 100 pounds of camera equipment and one that could take at least 30 frames a second best I could tell.&#160; Well, he may hav 10000 more pictures than me but he probably will spend at least the next two weeks messing with them in photoshop. Then there is me, the presentation ended 30 minutes ago and ... Blogged!</p>

<p>Noah Coad talking to attendees before the presentation finding out what there expectations are (I'm wondering if he changed his presentation based on what he heard?)</p>

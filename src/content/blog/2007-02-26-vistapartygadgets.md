<p>Today was my first presentation of the new Gadget technology in Vista.&#160; This presentation was done at Foothill College as part of the Vista Party.&#160; The goal was to present gadgets as an overview and give some insight into what it takes to develop them.&#160; Basically, there are two types of gadgets.&#160; Live Gadgets which are designed to run on web sites like live.com, and sidebar gadgets which are full fledged applications that are designed to run just on&#160; Vista.</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>In addition, I demonstrated the details of building a sidebar gadget that lets you monitor the readyboost technology in Vista.&#160; Unfortunately, it's still a work in progress.&#160; For security reason's I can't figure out how to get the data I need.&#160; I'm hoping at the MVP summit in a couple weeks, someone can help me figure this out.</p>

# Enhancing Security in Next.js with NextAuth: A Guide to Protected Pages

In the realm of web development, safeguarding specific pages from unauthorized access is not just a feature but a necessity. Next.js, renowned for its efficiency in building React applications, seamlessly integrates with NextAuth for authentication, offering a robust solution for securing pages. However, developers often grapple with a common issue: the brief exposure of protected content to unauthorized users before the application redirects them. This blog post delves into creating a protected page in Next.js using NextAuth, focusing on preventing the flash of unprotected content and employing advanced TypeScript practices for a more secure and professional implementation.

## The Challenge: Preventing Content Flash

A notable challenge in web application security is preventing the momentary display of protected content to unauthenticated users. This issue not only detracts from the user experience by momentarily showing content that should be inaccessible but also poses a potential security risk. The goal is to ensure that protected content remains invisible to unauthorized users at all times.

## The Solution: Introducing the WithAuth Component

To tackle this challenge, we introduce a higher-order component named `WithAuth`. This component leverages the `useSession` hook from NextAuth to monitor the user's authentication status and elegantly manage redirections, thereby ensuring that protected content remains secure from unauthorized access.

### Deep Dive into WithAuth Implementation

Let's explore the TypeScript implementation of the `WithAuth` component, emphasizing improved type definitions and React best practices:

```typescript
"use client";

import { useSession, SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react";
import React, { ReactNode, useEffect } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import { Session } from "next-auth";

interface WithAuthProps {
  children: ReactNode;
}

export function WithAuth({ children }: WithAuthProps): JSX.Element | null {
  const { data: session, status } = useSession();
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Handle the loading state
    if (status === "loading") return;
    // Redirect if not authenticated
    if (!session) {
      console.log("Redirecting to login page...");
      router.push("/login-page");
    }
  }, [status, session, router]);

  return session ? <>{children}</> : null;
}
```

In this component, `useSession` is a crucial hook that returns an object containing `session` data and `status`. The `status` can be one of three states: `"authenticated"`, `"unauthenticated"`, or `"loading"`. This information is pivotal for determining whether to display the protected content or redirect the user.

- **Authenticated**: The user is logged in, and the session is valid. Protected content can be safely rendered.
- **Unauthenticated**: The user is not logged in, or the session has expired. The user is redirected to the login page.
- **Loading**: The session status is being determined. During this state, we avoid rendering anything to prevent the flash of content.

By checking these states, the `WithAuth` component ensures that the content is only displayed to authenticated users, enhancing the application's security.

### Implementing Protected Pages

To secure a page with `WithAuth`, wrap the page content within this component. Here's how to apply it:

```typescript
"use client";

import React from "react";
import { SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react";
import { WithAuth } from './WithAuth'; // Ensure WithAuth is correctly imported

export default function ProtectedPageWrapper() {
  return (
    <SessionProvider>
      <WithAuth>
        <div>THIS IS A PROTECTED PAGE</div>
      </WithAuth>
    </SessionProvider>
  );
}
```

This structure ensures that the page content is shielded behind the authentication check, effectively preventing unauthorized access and the undesirable flash of protected content.

## Wrapping Up

Integrating the `WithAuth` component into your Next.js application not only fortifies your pages against unauthorized access but also enhances the user experience by ensuring that sensitive content remains invisible to unauthenticated users. This method not only secures your application but also leverages TypeScript's type safety and React's best practices for a more robust and professional development approach.

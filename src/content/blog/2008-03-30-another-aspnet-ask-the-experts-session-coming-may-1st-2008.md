<p>During the past couple years, I've participated as an expert in several ask the expert sessions.&#160; Typically what happens is a bunch of as MVP's and Regional Directors for different Microsoft technologies get together at a certain time and date (on a phone call) and work together to answer people's questions on asp.net topics. </p>
<p>Feel free to drop by and ask us something!&#160; Here is the link.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/">Windows 7</a> Beta, Build 7000 put through the paces)</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I don’t seem to have a pile of computers laying around anymore so testing new operating systems can be a bit time consuming.&#160; In general, I don’t like testing OS’s in VM’s because performance on the actual hardware is what I’m trying to measure.&#160; So, luckily, I do seem to have an infinite number of SATA hard drives for my Lenovo Thinkpad W500 ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FBMIFS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=petkelsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001FBMIFS">Lenovo 4062-27U ThinkPad W500 15.4&quot; Notebook</a><img style="border-bottom-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important; margin: 0px; border-top-style: none !important; border-left-style: none !important" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=petkelsblo-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001FBMIFS" width="1" height="1" /> ) so I figure the best thing to do is install the OS on one of those.&#160; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en/us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> recently sent me two DVD’s (a 32bit and a 64bit).&#160; Since I have a 64bit machine with 4gig of RAM, I figure I should test the 64bit.&#160; So, here we go.     </p>

<h2>The Installation Process</h2>
<p>If you have ever installed a Microsoft OS before, the steps are basically the same.&#160; Put the disk in, boot, go through the standard format disk screen (I like to erase all my partitions), then press go.&#160; What seems to vary between OS’s is the time to run through this process.&#160; So, here is how long it took for me.</p>

<p>Less than 20 minutes!&#160; Pretty impressive.&#160; I’d also like to note that it seemed all the devices on my Lenovo W500 worked best I can tell.&#160; The Video drivers installed perfectly (even supported my two monitors on my docking station), sound worked, wireless networking immediately connected to my home wifi and it felt very very fast.</p>
<p>Next thing, I test to see if it can find my network printers.&#160; I have two, an HP Deskjet 6470 and a Brother 8860DN.&#160; It finds them both!    </p>
<h2>Let’s Test some Software</h2>
<p>So, the first thing to test is Visual Studio 2008.&#160; I install that from a DVD (because I have not figure out how to mount ISO’s yet and MagicDVD is rumored not to work).&#160; It installs flawlessly as does VS2008 SP1 and the MVC Beta.&#160; Running it however gives me a little problem.&#160; I need to tell it to run as Admin and in Vista Compatibility mode for it to open my web projects (which work with IIS7).&#160; Then, I install subversion (tortoisesvn), still no problem, FireFox next, still no problem.&#160; Now to have some fun.</p>
<p>Next thing is I download the current Visual Studio 2008 project I’ve been working on with svn and build it.&#160;&#160; It builds fast and flawlessly.&#160; Then, I start running IE8 and Firefox just cruising the internet.&#160; Everything works without a hitch.   </p>
<h2>Anything Missing?</h2>
<p>The only thing that I couldn’t figure out how to do was mount ISO’s as driver letters.&#160; Most my software is stored as ISO’s so I really miss that.    </p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Well, if during the next year while Microsoft tests Windows 7, they restrain from filling it with features, this OS is a definite winner.&#160; It feels hugely faster than both XP and Vista.&#160; The graphics is just awesome.&#160; The transparencies feel natural, moving items around the start bar is easy, as well as visualizing what is running by hovering over the start bar is much smoother than Vista.</p>
<p>I can’t wait until this is my primary OS.&#160; I’m tempted to use it as my main OS but luckily my instincts prevent me from doing that.&#160; Microsoft clearly says this is for testing only and I choose to follow that.</p>

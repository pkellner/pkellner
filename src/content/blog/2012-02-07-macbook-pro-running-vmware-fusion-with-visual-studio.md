<p>I’ve been a macbook user for about 2 weeks now.&#160; As a Microsoft guy, it’s really important to me that the Macbook run Windows 7 really well.&#160; So far, I’m not impressed (hopefully this will change once you all give me some good advice).&#160; I’ve set up bootcamp on half my SSD drive and OSX Lion on the other half.&#160; VMWare seems to run reasonably well, but when I try and run Visual Studio I get lots of hanging and very very slow performance.&#160; I’ve got 16Gig of RAM and the latest macbook with a core i7.&#160; I’ve tried giving VMWARE 4 or 8 GB’s of ram, but have the same issues.</p>
<p>I’ve also run bootcamp native and had some hanging also, but not as bad as Fusion.</p>
<p>Anyone else have similar experiences?&#160; Any suggestions?&#160; I’ve heard that macbook’s are awesome at running windows 7.&#160; So far, I have not experience that.&#160; </p>

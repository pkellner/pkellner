<p>I’m leading a 3 hour hands on lab titled &quot;<a href="http://www.mindsource.com/">MindSource</a> Birds of a Feather 55 (BoF) - Developing Mobile Applications using <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/">SenchaTouch</a> 2.0&quot; on May 23rd in Mountain View California.&#160; This is our first go around this so we are limiting attendance so if you are interested, you’ll need to sign up asap.&#160; The URL to sign up is</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3491482117/mtup">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3491482117/mtup</a></p>
<p>We do have a small $20 free to both help cover some costs as well as get a clear picture of what attendance will be.&#160; MindSource will be picking up the additional expenses beyond the $20 paid fees.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<blockquote><p>Join us for this fast-paced hands-on lab where you will develop your own working mobile application to run on iPad, iPhones, and Android devices. Learn the fundamentals of developing mobile web applications with SenchTouch 2.0 by working in small teams to develop a rudimentary conference scheduling application and explore a number of important Sencha libraries.</p>
<p>The course will start with setting up a developer environment and creating your first “hello” App, cover the theory of mobile app design theory and the basics of MVC design, and progress to building the <a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/">Conference Session Viewer</a>, and create panels for button and toolbars.</p>
<p>After a break, then you will learn how to work create storage facilities and add styling. We will conclude with Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>Bring your own Laptop!&#160;&#160; Each module will take about 25 minutes, and if you get behind, you can take our completed code and move on to the next. This way, everyone will finish!</p>
<p>MindSource is honored to have <strong>Peter Kellner</strong> as our speaker.&#160; <em>Peter is founder and president of 73rd Street Associates and is a seasoned software professional specializing in high quality, scalable and extensible web applications.

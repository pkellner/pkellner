<p>This year I had the opportunity to work in the <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/gp/mvpawardintro" target="_blank">Microsoft MVP</a> Community meeting place (next to the wireless community center) as a game show host, computer runner of the questions, general answer person as well as just hanging out with the gang.&#160; I have to admit it was very fun.&#160; Turns out I was much better at running the computer than being the game show host, but after 4 days this, I realized I had not hosted one game.&#160; Today (Friday) things changed.&#160; Just before leaving for the airport&#160; I got my chance.</p>
<p>Below are pictures taken by Terry showing my solo performance.&#160; No one got any questions right.&#160; We were forced into a tie breaker.&#160; The first tie breaking question (what color was Spok's blood) was answered incorrectly.&#160; The second question, what color was George Washington's white horse was fortunately answered correctly.&#160; Otherwise, I might still be there.</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>Seriously though, the purpose of this meeting place was to let people know about the MVP program.&#160; Even though Microsoft heavily advertises the program in lots of technical magazines, lots of people don't know about.&#160; As an MVP for the past two years, I was a good person to talk about it.&#160;&#160; It was fun for me to talk to lots of people who came by, both MVP's as well as potential MVP's.</p>
<p>Here are some fun pictures.</p>

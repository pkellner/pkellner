<h2>Background</h2>
<p>For the past couple of years, I've been really impressed with how much content there is out there on the Internet in people's blogs.&#160; To harvest all this content, you really need some kind of aggregating software to help you organize all this content.&#160; For no real reason, the first aggregator I used was <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>.&#160; It worked pretty well but I got tired of days when it was very slow, and other days where this cute <a href="http://www.seopedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/bloglines-plumber.jpg">plumber</a> would be displayed telling me Bloglines was offline and I should come back later.&#160; About 2 months ago, I switched to <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a>.&#160; So far, I'm a happy camper.</p>

<h2>Google Reader Online</h2>
<p>To switch from Bloglines to Google Reader, there was a simple <a href="http://www.quickonlinetips.com/archives/2005/10/export-bloglines-subscriptions-to-google-reader/">&quot;export to standard format&quot;</a> and &quot;import from standard format&quot; that made moving all my subscriptions easy.&#160; Functionally, both do the same thing.&#160; They keep track of what I've read and give me a reasonable experience at viewing posts.&#160; Initially, I didn't like the Google Reader format but since I've been using it more, I've grown to like it better.&#160; It has lots of clientside javascript which makes it faster and it has subtle things like when you mouse over a post, it marks it as read (unless you click the button on the bottom saying &quot;mark as unread&quot;.</p>
<h2>Google Reader Offline</h2>
<p>This is really what I wanted to talk about.&#160; I'm currently flying home (to California) from a two week Italian bicycling vacation.&#160; I've been offline for&#160; a while and as you can imagine, I have over 2000 blog posts to catch up on.&#160; At the first airport, I decided to install Google's offline reader.&#160; The steps were pretty straight forward.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Google Gears </li>
<li>Press the Go Off Line Button at the top of the reader page </li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/groffline.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="groffline" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/groffline-thumb.png" width="362" height="173" /></a></p>
<p>Then, after about 2 minutes with a nice progress dialog,&#160;&#160; <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> told me all my subscribed posts were synchronized.&#160; This was at the Nice airport.&#160; I jumped on my airplane, fired up the browser, went to <a href="http://reader.google.com">http://reader.google.com</a> and nothing happened.&#160; Just an error message saying DNS could not be resolved.&#160; Well, back to reading the newspaper.</p>
<p>In Brussels (my next stop) I went on line to the <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> help and it said it should have worked.&#160; By accident, I discovered if I set the browser (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx">IE7</a>) to offline mode, my Google reader worked.&#160; This is done by going into IE7 tools menu and selecting offline.</p>
<p><a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/gr1.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="gr1" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/gr1-thumb.png" width="362" height="262" /></a></p>
<p>So, I'm sitting on the airplane from JFK to SFO after a 6 hour weather delay in NY reading my blog posts.&#160; Very impressive if you ask me.</p>
<h2>Problem, the MORE button on posts</h2>
<p>One problem I have noticed is that if the blog has a short summary, then a more button all you get off line is the more button and not the context (like my blog for example).&#160; I need to fix my blog to not do that, though I'm not sure what the standard is.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I'm much happier having my blog aggregator available offline.&#160; I have not used it a lot, but from this one plan trip, I have learned a lot of things I would not otherwise have had the opportunity to.&#160; Offline blog reading with Google blog reader is a good thing.</p>

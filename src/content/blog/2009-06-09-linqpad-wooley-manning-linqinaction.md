<p> Last night, I had the honor of having dinner with three other VSLive speakers including Jim Wooley, one of the authors of the awesome book on LINQ titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1933988169/petkelsblo-20">LINQ in Action</a>.&#160; Jim is a wealth of knowledge as well as very entertaining.&#160; He had an interesting analogy for what using try/catch statements to handle expected issues.&#160; I’ll leave it up to you to post to his twitter account and find out what it was.&#160; it’s just a little off color and I don’t want to be rejected from search engines.</p>

<p>At anyrate, I’m now following Jim’s Twitter feed and he recently mentioned he included all the examples from his book in <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPAD</a>.&#160; I just downloaded them.&#160; This is just too cool!&#160; He wrote a blog post about it here:&#160; <a title="http://www.thinqlinq.com/Default/LINQ-In-Action-Samples-available-in-LINQPad.aspx" href="http://www.thinqlinq.com/Default/LINQ-In-Action-Samples-available-in-LINQPad.aspx">http://www.thinqlinq.com/Default/LINQ-In-Action-Samples-available-in-LINQPad.aspx</a>&#160; Here is what it looks like in LINQPAD</p>
<p><a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/image4.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/image_thumb2.png" width="593" height="355" /></a></p>
<p>Hope this helps!!!&#160; It’s huge for me.</p>

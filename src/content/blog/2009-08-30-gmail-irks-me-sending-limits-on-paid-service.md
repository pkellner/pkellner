<p>As the main organize for Silicon Valley Code Camp, I often do small mailings to certain groups of people.&#160; I expect that I should be able to send emails to 122 people by simply copying them into my cc field and pressing send.</p>
<p>Well, I did that and after 100, I get the message:</p>
<p><a title="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=22839" href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=22839">http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=22839</a></p>

<p><em>In an effort to fight spam and prevent abuse, Google will temporarily disable your account if you send a message to more than 500 recipients or if you send a large number of undeliverable messages. If you use a POP or IMAP client (Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail, e.g.), you may only send a message to 100 people at a time. Your account should be re-enabled within 24 hours.</em></p>
<p>I understand if Google want to put ridiculous limits on it’s free accounts (how can you complain), but I’m paying Google for this!&#160; And now, they have disable my account for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Just had to vent. There are so many things I don’t like about GMail, this one is just over the top.</p>

<p>The same authors who write the original <a href="/2008/11/28/extjs-bookreview/">Learning Ext JS</a> are back and definitely with a winner here.&#160; Just to start out, the book is about a third longer, has a new contributing author (Nigel White, aka “<a href="http://www.sencha.com/forum/member.php?10-Animal">Animal</a>” on the ExtJS Forums) and definitely packs a lot more content.&#160; You get the feeling these guys took the feedback they got on the first book and went to town.</p>
<p>To start with, they have lots and lots of examples covering a lot more areas. There is a lot more architectural discussions that really help in building high end <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/js/">ExtJS</a> applications. Chapter 13 for example is completely devoted to code reuse (extending <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/js/">ExtJS</a>).&#160; New features such as Ext.Direct are discussed extensively as well as the new graphics library (but don’t take that too seriously because it is being replaced with a non-flash version in ExtJS 4.0 which is coming out soon).</p>
<p>Overall, I give this book a solid A.&#160; I’m even fortunate enough to get mine signed by Shea Frederick, one of the authors (see picture below).</p>

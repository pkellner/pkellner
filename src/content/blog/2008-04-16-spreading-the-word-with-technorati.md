  <p>So, I'm at MVP Summit in Redmond and last night, while talking with Scott Guthrie, he was telling us about his Technorati rank, and how he had millions of references.   My understanding  is Technorati is basically a search engine for blogs.  So, I must join!.  they asked me to put a small piece of html in my post to claim my blog, so.. Here it is.</p>

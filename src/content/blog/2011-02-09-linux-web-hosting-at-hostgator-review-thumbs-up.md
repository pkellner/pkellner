<h3>Background</h3>
<p>About a month ago,&#160; purchased to Level 3 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VPS">VPS</a> (Virtual Private Servers) running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux">Linux</a> for about $50 a piece.&#160; I’m close to launching a new product and that’s product customized shopping experience, forums and web site are all built with <a href="http://php.net">php</a>.&#160; I had several things that were important to me.</p>
<ol>
<li>Full Service Linux Hosting</li>
<li>PCI Certified for processing Credit Cards</li>
<li>First Class Customer Service</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve always known of <a href="http://www.hostgator.com/shared.shtml">HostGator</a> by it’s excellent reputation so it was an easy choice.&#160; Up until this week, I did&#160; not realize what an excellent decision I had made.</p>
<p>  <!--more--><br />
<h3>Some Details</h3>
<p>After getting our welcome letter on our first server, we started installing our software.&#160; We gave HostGator a list of what was needed (php version, mysql, secure ftp, etc.) and they promptly went to work configuring things.&#160; Once the server was ready, we began loading.&#160; Without going into too much detail, we started having lots of issues.&#160; HostGator immediately spun up new VPS instances for us and unfortunately, we kept having problems.&#160; After a couple days, HostGator assigned a manager to our account who totally took care of us.&#160; We quickly got to the bottom of our problems and now everything is running really smoothly.</p>
<p>At this point, I feel like part of the family.&#160; Our new manager friend at HostGator has continued to follow up, even after things are running well.&#160; </p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Rating an organizations customer service is an interesting exercise because unless you’ve had a hard problem, it’s hard to really know what would happen if there was one.&#160; Kind of like asking for a good airplane pilot.&#160; You don’t want one who has never been in a tough situation because if something bad happens on your flight, you want a pilot that’s been through worse.</p>
<p>Well, as I explained in the details section above, I did have problems.&#160; I can’t say for sure why I had the problems, but in the end, <a href="http://www.hostgator.com/shared.shtml">HostGator</a> totally stepped up and made sure I was take care of.&#160; We are close to releasing our product and I have so many things to keep track of, it’s nice not to have to worry about the servers.</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="http://www.hostgator.com/shared.shtml">HostGator</a>!&#160;&#160; I’m a very happy camper.</p>

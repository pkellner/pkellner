<p>I've been working on a project lately that requires a lot of <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">JavaScript</a>, and if any of you are like me, you've had trouble learning the language well.&#160; Over the years, I've taken several runs at it but have not been successful.&#160; Sure, I could always to basic stuff, but it seemed that when ever I need to do anything useful, I just could not figure it out.&#160; Well, times have changed.&#160; Mostly based on my need to know the language, I am really starting to feel good about the language. I'm understanding scoping, I can throw functions and arrays around as well as actually do useful stuff.</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>My path to success has been two books.&#160; First, <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford's</a> JavaScript: The Good Parts is really all about the why.&#160; That is, what is good and what is not.&#160; It not only tells you how to do things (though in very compact language), it tells you why.&#160; One very nice thing it does it explains the rational for things and&#160; where compromises have been made.&#160; It's short and dense.&#160; That is, kind of K&amp;G for c, it does not mince words.&#160; I'm on my 3rd pass now and still learning things.</p>
<p>When I need more words, I go to the other book.&#160; JavaScript: The Definitive Guide by <a href="http://www.davidflanagan.com/">David Flanagan</a>.&#160; It doe a great job of explaining in details all the little parts of JavaScript in a non-dense way.&#160; It's about 4 times longer than The Good Parts and does get a little wordy at times, but for me, I often need the extra words.</p>
<p>I could not live without both of these books.</p>

<p>I was surprised and happy to receive notification of being awarded the MVP for ASP.NET 2.0. During the past 18 months, I've spent a lot of time both learning the technology as well as being involved in the community that it supports. During that time, I've done lots of posting (both questions and answers) on the   <br /><a href="http://forums.asp.net/">asp.net </a>forums.&#160; In addition, I'd spoken at 4 code camps including the one I organized in Northern California ( <a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com">     <br />http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com</a> ).&#160; I'm sure it didn't hurt that during this period I authored four MSDN articles.</p>
<p>At any rate, I'm very happy and fortunate to receive this award and look forward to future opportunities to be even more involved in the exciting community around asp.net.</p>

<p>Many of you know that my favorite technical book in the world was Pro ASP.NET 2.0 and C# 2005 by Mathew MacDonald.  Well, Mathew has done it again.  I can't believe I didn't know it was coming, but there I was in the book store looking for books on LINQ and right in front of me was his new book with a nice chapter on LINQ.  So, it's now mine!  It's also got a large section on all the new Ajax stuff that I'm looking forward to reading.  I'm mostly a back end database kind of guy but I know I need to learn the javascript stuff better.  I can do it, but not as well as I'd like to be able to.</p>
<p>Run don't walk.  go buy this book!</p>

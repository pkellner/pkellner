<p>I just noticed that in the beta of <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/">Google Analytics</a>, you can now see <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/09/whats-happening-on-your-site-right-now.html">real time statistics</a> of what is going on for a web site.&#160; As a numbers junky, this is totally awesome!&#160; I just have to keep myself from spending all my time looking at this page.&#160; Below is a screen shot of what I’m seeing right now for traffic on <a href="https://peterkellner.net">https://peterkellner.net</a>.&#160; just to summarize, here is what it is telling me:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>7 people are browsing my site right now.</li>
<li>They got there with searches including “androd samsung epic sprint connection error” among others</li>
<li>The Map shows where in the world they are all connecting from</li>
<li>82% of these are new and 18% returning</li>
<li>The site is averaging about 3 or 4 page views per minute (not requests)</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>The other cool new feature is click tracking.&#160; That is, tracking how many people clicked “contact us” from any given post.&#160;&#160; As a developer who has a service business and always looking for new customers, it’s important for me to know which pages provoke people into wanting to contact us for help with there projects.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>That’s it for now!</p>

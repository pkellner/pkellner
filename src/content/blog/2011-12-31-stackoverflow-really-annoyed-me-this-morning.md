<p>For the past month or so, I’ve been more involved at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> than I have ever been.&#160; I’ve accumulated 317 points (not much, but enough to be part of the community) and until this morning, I had forgotten what I don’t like about this community site.</p>
<p>Specifically, I asked a very straight forward question which I feel I asked both respectfully and appropriately.&#160; I created a very succinct title and tagged it in a very reasonable way.&#160; I’m definitely not a JavaScript/IPad wizard, but I do know how to effectively work with community forums.</p>
<p>My Question:&#160; “<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8685978/heuristically-figuring-out-whether-im-running-ipad1-or-ipad2">Heuristically figuring out whether I'm running IPad1 or IPad2</a>”</p>
<p>Let me go through the responses 1 by 1 and I think you will see how this really annoyed me.</p>
<ol>
<li>nnnnn responds with “<u>what do you mean “heuristically</u>”.&#160;&#160;&#160; Well nnnn, shall I google that for you?&#160; how about if you read my question and looked up heuristically you would know the answer to your own question, but then, nnnnn has over 9000 points so who am I to suggest something like that.</li>
<li>Mitch tells me to “<u>Fix the cause, NOT the symptoms</u>”.&#160; Well Mitch, did you find that in some book of snappy forum retorts?&#160; How do you know that my problems can be fixed by reducing memory usage without killing the usefulness of the solution.&#160; No Mitch, you don’t know that so another unhelpful answer, but again, Mitch has over 11,000 points so again, how am I to criticize.</li>
<li>Finally, the last comment (by definition) says “<u>closed as exact duplicate</u> by Sam152 (5917 points), nnnnn (9527 points), Don Roby (11,854 points), Mitch Wheat (103,375 points) and Ben Voight (66,445 points).&#160; There reason which is that my question is a duplicate is patently false.&#160; Also, the answer they point to is also patently false!&#160; Running IOS 5.0.1 on both IPad1 and IPad2 return identical device strings.&#160; I know because I have both devices and I’ve tested that.&#160; Not only that, I’m guessing none of all those high point people even read my question which explicitly asked for a heuristic solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bottom line, very frustrating.&#160; I’m sure there a lot of good things going on at stackoverflow, however today, I feel like a squashed bug with my question.&#160; On a slightly positive note, 2 people did point out that the question shows research effort and voted up the question so I guess it’s not a lost cause (even though the door has been slammed shut but the 5 stack overflow veterans who marked the question as “exact duplicate”.&#160; I asked for it to be reopened but I suspect after this post I will probably lose my 317 points for questioning the kings.</p>

description: Master the art of flexible, dynamic logging in your Prisma setup with a powerful functionâ€”`getPrismaOptions()`. This function allows you to easily toggle between various logging levels without changing your code, offering a robust, maintainable, and environment-sensitive way to manage database operations. Learn how to set this up using an `.env` file, and understand why this approach can be a game-changer for your application's debugging and performance optimization needs.

# Mastering Prisma Logging with Dynamic Configuration: A Complete Guide

## Introduction

While developing applications that interface with databases, logging is a vital aspect. [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), a well-known ORM, offers logging options to capture database events, errors, and queries. But how can we make this more dynamic and controlled? In this post, we're dissecting a nifty function called `getPrismaOptions()` to flexibly manage logging configurations using environment variables. This function can return various logging configurations based on the setup in an `.env` file, giving us the power to toggle logging levels without altering code.

## The getPrismaOptions Function Explained

### Complete Function Code

Firstly, let's look at the complete code for `getPrismaOptions()`.

```typescript
type LogOption = {
  emit: "event" | "stdout";
  level: "query" | "error" | "info" | "warn";
};

function getPrismaOptions(): { log: LogOption[] } {
  const queryLogging = process.env.PRISMA_EVENT_QUERY !== "false"; // default true
  const errorLogging = process.env.PRISMA_STDOUT_ERROR !== "false"; // default true
  const infoLogging = process.env.PRISMA_STDOUT_INFO === "true"; // default false
  const warnLogging = process.env.PRISMA_STDOUT_WARN === "true"; // default false

  const logOptions: LogOption[] = [];

  if (queryLogging) {
    logOptions.push({
      emit: "event",
      level: "query",
    });
  }

  if (errorLogging) {
    logOptions.push({
      emit: "stdout",
      level: "error",
    });
  }

  if (infoLogging) {
    logOptions.push({
      emit: "stdout",
      level: "info",
    });
  }

  if (warnLogging) {
    logOptions.push({
      emit: "stdout",
      level: "warn",
    });
  }

  return {
    log: logOptions,
  };
}
```


### Setting Variables From an .env File

The key to the dynamic nature of this function is its reliance on environment variables, specifically set in an `.env` file.

Example of `.env` file content:

```bash
PRISMA_EVENT_QUERY=true
PRISMA_STDOUT_ERROR=true
PRISMA_STDOUT_INFO=false
PRISMA_STDOUT_WARN=false
```

Here, you define the values for `PRISMA_EVENT_QUERY`, `PRISMA_STDOUT_ERROR`, `PRISMA_STDOUT_INFO`, and `PRISMA_STDOUT_WARN`. To use these in your Node.js application, you would require the `dotenv` package to load them.

Run `npm install dotenv` or `yarn add dotenv`, and then at the start of your application (typically in `index.js` or `app.js`), add:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
```

This would load all the variables from `.env` into `process.env`, making them available in `getPrismaOptions()`.

### How Environment Variables Control Logging

The environment variables control whether certain types of logs are active:

* `PRISMA_EVENT_QUERY`: Toggles query logs.
* `PRISMA_STDOUT_ERROR`: Toggles error logs.
* `PRISMA_STDOUT_INFO`: Toggles information logs.
* `PRISMA_STDOUT_WARN`: Toggles warning logs.

For example, setting `PRISMA_EVENT_QUERY` to `true` in the `.env` file will enable query logging, while setting it to `false` will disable it.

## Why You Need getPrismaOptions

### Dynamic Configuration

One main advantage of this approach is that you can change your logging preferences dynamically, without touching the source code.

### Environment-Specific Logging

With `.env` files, you can specify different configurations for development, staging, and production. For example, in development, you might need all logging levels, while in production, you may just require error logging for optimal performance.

### Code Cleanliness

Consolidating your log configuration logic in one function makes your codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

## Conclusion

By embracing `getPrismaOptions()`, you can efficiently manage Prisma's logging capabilities, making your application not only more maintainable but also adaptable to various environments. Utilizing environment variables through an `.env` file gives you fine-grained control over what gets logged and where, offering a flexible development experience tailored to your needs.

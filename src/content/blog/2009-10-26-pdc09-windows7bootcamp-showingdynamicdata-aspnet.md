<p> Microsoft’s big developer conference (PDC <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/">http://microsoftpdc.com/</a>) happens about every other year when Microsoft has big announcements.&#160; Turns out, there was one last year, and for the first time ever, they are having a second one in row this year.&#160; Reason is because of large announcements from Microsoft including Windows 7.</p>
<p>The conference is Tuesday through Friday.&#160; On Monday, there are special invents, usually full day in nature.&#160; I’ve been asked to participate in the <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/WKSP08">Windows 7 Bootcamp on Monday</a> showing some of the new technology that is available from Microsoft.</p>

<p>My little piece is to talk about the new <a href="http://www.asp.net/dynamicdata/">Dynamic Data</a> Feature built into asp.net.&#160; Basically, what Dynamic Data gives you in a nut shell is the ability to easily make web apps easier for showing all kind of different data types.</p>
<p>For example, if you happen to have a picture stored with each user’s profile, Dynamic Data gives you a straight forward, easy to implement way of uploading and displaying that data in a standard ASP.NET control like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.gridview.aspx">GridView</a>, ListView, DetailsView, etc.&#160; Another example is that say you have a “State” field that is 2 characters long in your database.&#160; Dynamic Data allows you to have validation for that with practically no code.</p>
<p>Dynamic Data is truly one of the most innovative developer technologies Microsoft has brought out IMHO.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there.</p>

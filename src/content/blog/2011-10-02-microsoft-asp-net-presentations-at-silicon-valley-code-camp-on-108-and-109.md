<p><a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/">SV Code Camp</a> is happening next weekend with well over 200 sessions.&#160; The conference is really technology agnostic and try hard to keep it that way, but I am an ASP.NET guy these days so I think it reasonable I take my Code Camp Coordinator hat off for the moment and put on my ASP.NET hat.&#160; As an ASP.NET Microsoft MVP, I feel I’m in a good position to give a tour of some sessions in ASP.NET and throw in my own 2 cents.&#160; Below are a list of these sessions in no particular order.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Sessions.aspx?OnlyOne=true&amp;id=687">Demystifying ASP.NET MVC, $(Lino).MVC{getknowledge()}</a></h3>
<p><strong>Sunday, October 9th 9:45AM</strong></p>
<p>MVC (Model View Controller) is one of the hottest patterns around building web sites these days no matter what the technology. When Microsoft first introduced Web programming to Visual Studio, they did it such that almost anyone who had done windows programming (VB or other) could quickly come up to speed and build a web site. Personally, this what sucked me into web programming. Drag a button, drag a textbox, double click on the button and add some code to set the text box and WHAM, you have a web site. Unfortunately, as things get more complicated, this model does not scale so well. <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">ASP.NET's MVC implementation</a> does scale, it takes a little bit of flipping your mind around if you are Web Forms programmer, but definitely worth learning about and seeing if it's right for you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Speakers.aspx?AttendeeId=529">Lino Tadros</a> is one of my favorite presenters and I'm sure will give you a much better understanding of MVC and how it fits into the ASP.NET programming model. I strongly recommend this one. Lino is the CEO for one of the top Application development and training companies in the world that partners with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://falafel.com/default.aspx">Falafel Software</a>. In other words, GO TO THIS SESSION!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Sessions.aspx?OnlyOne=true&amp;id=823">Pragmatic JavaScript, jQuery &amp; Ajax with ASP.NET</a></h3>
<p>Saturday, October 9th 1:45PM</p>
<p><a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Speakers.aspx?AttendeeId=6788">Damian Edwards</a> is a Program Manager on the Microsoft ASP.NET team.&#160; That’s right, he is flying here from Redmond just to present to us.&#160; He’s also an awesome presenter and we are extremely lucky to have him at Code Camp!&#160;&#160; Damien will tak about using JQuery while building sites with the Microsoft ASP.NET framework.&#160; Something Damien knows very very well.&#160; For those who don’t know, Damien is also leading the next generation efforts around ASP.NET WebForms which is the technology 90% of who use ASP.NET use (it’s what the <a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/">silicon valley code camp</a> web site is built with).</p>
<p>DON’T MISS THIS PRESENTATION!</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Sessions.aspx?OnlyOne=true&amp;id=627">WebMatrix In Depth</a></h3>
<p> </a>
<p>Saturday, October 9th&#160; 5:00PM</p>
<p><a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Speakers.aspx?AttendeeId=6011">John Sheehan</a>, one of the best guys I know at explaining complex things is presenting this session on WebMatrix.&#160; I’m not sure everyone would agree with me, but for those people that really don’t like the heavy weight feeling of building web applications with Visual Studio, <a href="http://www.asp.net/webmatrix">WebMatrix</a> will make you feel right at home. It’s much lighter weight and also gives tons of punch.&#160; Come see John and ask him a million questions!&#160; He loves that.</p>

<p>The Scrum developer training is happening a week from Monday and I just got a notification that they are offering a 2 for 1 deal.&#160; Pretty amazing.&#160; I know this is a new class and they want to get as much feedback as they can so I assume that is why they are making this offer.</p>
<p>If you are a developer and have heard a lot about SCRUM, Sprints, Agile, etc., this is a great opportunity to learn the hands on part of how to make the most out of being on an agile team.</p>
<p>I blogged some more details previously at the URL:&#160; <a title="https://peterkellner.net/2009/10/14/scrum-training-course-mountainview-richard-hundhausen/" href="/2009/10/14/scrum-training-course-mountainview-richard-hundhausen/">https://peterkellner.net/2009/10/14/scrum-training-course-mountainview-richard-hundhausen/</a></p>

<p>I love to go myself, but I’m pushing to make a deadline that happens right at that time.&#160; You won’t regret if you go.&#160; It is in my backyard, and I do plan on stopping by to say hi at least once.</p>
<p>Good luck and I hope you can make it.&#160; I’m sure you won’t regret, and the world will be a better place.</p>

  <p>On Day 2 of the Silverlight Dev Camp In San Francisco there were lots of great presentations.   I gave one on adding animation to a silverilght application using blend, then wiring it up to work with Silverlight Alpha 1.1.  I also showed Searchlight and DiggPopular.  Two Silverlight applications I've written.  This post includes my slide deck and source for what I demonstrated.   </p>

<p>Day 2 (Saturday) was packed full of interesting presentations.&#160; From about 4:30 to 5:00, I did a presentation on how to build animations with blend and use them in Silverlight.&#160; Here is the description:</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt">In this presentation, I'll talk about the implementation details of building the picture slider used in the Community Media Browser preview hosted at http://labs.leveragesoftware.com/gallery.html .&#160; In this informal talk I'll discuss how LoadXaml() was critical to this process as well as other tricks.&#160; Because the picture slider is running from a live web feed, there      <br />is no way to know ahead of time how many picture we may have to scroll so clipping type solutions just don't make sense.&#160; Time permitting, we'll talk about other issues involved in building this application and of course take questions.<o  :p></o></span></p>
<p>The slides and presentation are all bundled up in this zip file if you would like to download them.</p>

  For the second time this year, first by awarded an MVP for ASP.NET, and now the community assigned to maintaining the integrity
  and consistency for the asp.net forums has invited me to join them.  For those of you that don't know what
  moderators do, basically, as I understand it, there job is keep the forums running smoothly.  It involves a lot of moving posts to
  correct forums, approving posts of new members,and of course trying to keep things civil whenever possible.

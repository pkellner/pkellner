<p>I will be speaking in a couple weeks at the <a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/">Silicon Valley Code Camp</a> in Los Altos, California on November 9th.&#160; The camp is both Saturday and Sunday.&#160; There are almost <a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/SessionsOverview.aspx">13 sessions every 90 minutes</a> so come out and enjoy lots of topics.&#160; My particular session is on High Performance ASP.NET Web Sites. I'll talk about not only ASP.NET, but also, a lot of the concepts I'll be discussing are more general in nature and apply to all web sites.</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>Here is a brief description:</p>
<p><em>Topics will include appropriate use of Cache and Session State, as well as how and when to use them. Viewstate management and methods to minimize its use will be discussed. Code to pop up a warning when a threshold is met in development will be shown. When and how to take advantage of Server Farms will be discussed, as well as trouble shooting techniques to find problems. The evils of Server Affinity, as well as a common pattern for caching database queries will be shown to be wrong. Time permitting, we will talk about using Microsoftâ€™s Ajax.asp.net with <a href="http://www.asp.net/ajax/documentation/live/overview/UpdatePanelOverview.aspx">UpdatePanel</a> and webservices and how these affect performance and scalability.</em></p>
<p><em>Hope to see you there!</em></p>

<p>So, for those of you that don’t know me well, suffice it to say, I have less than no sense of direction.&#160; I always manage to make my way home, but often with a lot of zigs and zags.&#160; So, why should this morning be any different.&#160; After arriving in LA around rush hour, I thought the best move would be to take the bus to Union Center (downtown LA), then the train to the convention center.&#160; On the bus, I met a very nice Japanese woman (living in LA) who helped me get on the train in the right direction.&#160; Having shorter legs than me, I got to the convention center first and promptly started walking in the wrong direction.&#160; She chased me down and let me know that I was heading in the wrong direction. </p>

<p>Funny thing was that two other people had seen me in my MVP shirt (I’m sitting at the experts table today talking about <a href="http://www.asp.net/dynamicdata/">Dynamic Data</a> at <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/WhatsHappening/FREE-Windows-7-Developer-Boot-Camp-Nov-16">Windows 7 Boot Camp</a>) and had promptly followed me thinking I certainly must know where I’m going (<a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/">Microsoft PDC</a> conference, <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/">Microsoft MVP</a> shirt and all).</p>

<p>Many client side improvements can be implemented in under 10 minute.

This presentation will focus on client site performance tips, that is things like cache headers, JavaScript optimizations, CDN's and Sprite's. JavaScript techniques such as clean separation of concerns, De-referencing objects, and thinking asynchronous when working with objects will be discussed.

<p>ASP.NET’s <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">WebAPI</a> and SPA’s (single page apps) are all the rage!</p>
<blockquote><p>In our brave new world, many web apps are now Single Page Applications written in JavaScript. Basically, this means that instead of having lots of static and/or dynamic pages generating lots of HTML, we now often have an html page that has just a few lines. Those lines would be just some basic header files, a css file included and a couple JavaScript include files. There are several JavaScript frameworks that support this scenario: <a href="http://www.sencha.com/">Sencha’s</a> SenchaTouch and ExtJS, as well as Dojo, Yahoo’s YUI and others immediately come to mind.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we will focus on what the back end ASP.NET server can look like to support these kind of applications, and how to use Repositories and unit tests. This style of web apps development raises interesting issues - so bring your questions and concerns!</p>

<p>I’m not sure if this option was always there, or it just got added but recently, while doing development I noticed that next to each line of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> code the relevant variables in the line are being displayed and evaluated.  I’ve highlighted in yellow a couple of these values below.  You can see in the orangish brown text background below what chrome is showing.</p>
<p>This means I have to to way less adding variables to watch, less copying to command line below or in a separate window.</p>
<p>Bravo <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools">Chome Dev Tools</a>!  This totally makes my day, week and maybe even month. Just feeling the need to give those guys a shout out.</p>

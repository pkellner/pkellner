<p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about ransomware attacks.&#160; That is, when a virus infects your computer and encrypts all your files.&#160; Then, you get a notice that says if you pay a certain amount of money you will get access to your files.&#160; I gather it’s the most common malware out there right now.&#160; You can read more about what ransomware is here:</p>
<p><a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware</a></p>
<p>I’ve recently read multiple consumer articles on how to best protect yourself and I believe most of what I read is just wrong.&#160; Those articles say things like you can recover files that have not been encrypted yet if you catch it early, cloud is a good solution because the ransom ware can not infect the cloud.&#160; I call BS on that.</p>
<p>I assume ransomware is going to install itself on your computer and lie dormant for months so that all your backups to the cloud will ultimately have unusable data on them.&#160; I also believe ransom ware will go after all your drive shares and if you are backing up to a local hard disk through an unprotected share, that will get targeted also.</p>
<p>Here is what I am doing.</p>
<ul>
<li>I use Acronis and have two backup schemes that both go to NAS (network attached storage).&#160; One uses ftp and the other uses a username password unknown to my normal windows explorer.</li>
<li>I use Dropbox and have bought packrat which stores my backup history forever.&#160; I believe that way I always have a backup though it may be very old</li>
<li>I run WebRoot virus protection to minimize exposure though I know this does not stop zero day attacks.&#160; I’m hoping it stops most attacks though and since I’m not a huge target to the bad guys this is likely enough.</li>
<p> I feel like this is as much as I can do.&#160; HTH’s.</ul>
<p> Best Regards in Paranoia, -Peter</p>

<p>Visual Studio Debug/Trace Tricks From the Learning Center With Steve Carol</p>
<p>I love these meetings!&#160; I have to admit that I come not for the sessions, but for the learning center.&#160; At the moment I'm working on a .net Silverlight application and I've got lots of problems.&#160; What I do is put the mark $$$ in my code in all the places where I'm having problems.&#160; I trek over to the learning center area and sit down with a Microsoft engineer who is willing to tolerate me.&#160; Today, the guy was Steve Carroll who I believe is a manager on the visual studio performance team.&#160; Score!&#160; Big time help, and some bonuses also.&#160; Steve didn't really know anything about WPF   <br />or Silverlight but knows c# very very well.&#160; I asked him if he was a c# wizard at the start and he said no.&#160; He was very wrong about that.</p>

<p>So, here we are, all smiles.</p>

<p>So, not only did I get huge help, but Steve showed me some very cool tricks.&#160; Specifically how to turn trace output on in the debugger.&#160; Basically, you go to the debug point you set, right mouse button on it and you get this menu, you choose &quot;When Hit&quot;.</p>

<p>Then, you get the following dialog where you put stuff you want to get displayed when the point gets hit (without stopping).&#160; Basically, it logs it all to the output window.&#160; You can put your own variables in parenthesis, or any text you want.</p>

<p>Awesome feature!&#160;&#160; Now, I've given a little back after learning so much.&#160; Four and half days left!</p>

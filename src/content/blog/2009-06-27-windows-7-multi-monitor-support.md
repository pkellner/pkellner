<p>I’ve finally moved my Lenovo W500 over to Windows 7 RC.&#160; What motivated me was my wireless networking was getting really really unstable.&#160; Sometimes it would connect, other times it would not, and it never seemed to want to work at starbucks anymore.</p>
<p>So, here I am, and so far, vary happy.&#160; I did try the Windows 7 beta and had some weirdness with Visual Studio 2008, but so far, everything has been perfect.&#160; I do know the Microsoft folks have advertised that it contains better multi-monitor support.&#160; I don’t know exactly what that means, but I have two monitors running off my Lenovo.&#160; One is 2560x1600 and the other is 1600x1200.&#160; One hassle I always had was moving a windows that was too big for the small monitor.&#160; Now, I find that when I drag from the bigger to smaller, if the app is to big, it automatically get’s resized!&#160; Nice Job MS!</p>

<p>Also, the appearance display is nicer. There is more granularity in letting you line up the monitors.&#160; That is, my smaller one is centered next to the bigger one and I can align them exactly now as the screen show shows.</p>
<p><a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/image6.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/image_thumb4.png" width="350" height="321" /></a></p>
<p>That’s it for now.&#160; See you.</p>

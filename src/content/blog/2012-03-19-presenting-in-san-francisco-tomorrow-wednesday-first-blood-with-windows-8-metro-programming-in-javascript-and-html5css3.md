<p>Event Description</p>
<p>Do you want to know what it would be like to build your first Windows 8 Metro App in HTML5/CSS3 with the BUILD bits distributed by Microsoft last year? Having just submitted an app to the windows 8 app store contest, I (Peter Kellner) will give you a guided tour of the steps I went through. This includes running the preview of Blend (HTML5 only), Visual Studio 2011 Preview, all the sample code Microsoft provides as well as the documentation you will run into if you try to do the same thing. Windows 8 Metro programming is going to be too big for any of us to ignore. If you want to get a jump start on this new way of programming windows programming, come to the presentation and hopefully, save yourself many hours of newby mistakes (like I made). Hope to see you there!</p>

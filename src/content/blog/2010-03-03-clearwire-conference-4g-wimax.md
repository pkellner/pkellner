<p> Yesterday, I went to the CLEAR 4G WiMax Conference at the San Jose Convention Center.&#160; It’s the second conference like this I’ve been to.&#160; The first one was last October and was hosted by Sprint called the Sprint 2009 Open Developers Conference.</p>
<p>My take away is that fast broadband is coming, it’s coming fast (meant as a pun) and us developers need to make sure we are building apps to take advantage of it!</p>
<p>As usual, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/1173943808/">Newton Chan (Professor Foothill College)</a> sniffed out the perfect place to be to get free stuff.&#160; <a href="http://www.clear.com/">CLEAR</a> gave away 20 4G devices and lucky for me I was second on line.&#160; The devices they gave us covered 3 areas not to far from where I live so I drove this morning to one of those areas and tested my new card. OMG!!! Check out the speed!&#160; I could get really use to this.&#160; 1.99Mbps Down, 1.01 Mbps up.&#160; That’s about 7 times faster than I normally get with 3G.</p>

<p>So,&#160;&#160; if you are like me, you go to these conferences and listen to the presenter with one ear, and work on something else with everything else.&#160; At the closing key note, Dow Draper, Vice President Product development at CLEARWIRE said several things that really got my attention so I thought I’d list them.&#160; I can’t guarantee them as facts, but very interesting.</p>
<ul>
<li>He would only talk 20 minutes instead of the full hour since he knew he was between us and foot (Thanks Dan) </li>
<li>Based on bill scraping data CLEAR has, IPhones on average use about 200MB/Month of download.&#160; CLEAR expects 7.5 GIG per month when WiMAX gets adopted </li>
<li>WiMAX costs 10% of what the current 3G network costs.&#160; I don’t know what this means at all, but it sure got my attention. </li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it for now.&#160; It will be a 4G world soon.. I can’t wait.</p>

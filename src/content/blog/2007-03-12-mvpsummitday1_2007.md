<p>From Left to right, Peter Kellner (me), Mike Banavige from New England, and Curt Christianson from Wisconsin. Curt has made me &quot;Not the Newbie&quot; on the moderators team, and Mike, well, Mike just always has all the answers and continues to be a great role model for us&#160; (for the record, Curt says there are over           <br />200 breweries in Wisconsin).</p>

<p>Today was the first day of the Microsoft MVP Summit here in Seattle.&#160; I left beautiful and sunny San Jose California yesterday and today, I find myself in rainy Seattle (big surprise).&#160; OK, actually it turned nice later in the day &quot;after&quot; I had gone to the market area this morning and got drenched.&#160; I was obvious a foreigner because the only protection I had from the rain was the New York Times I bought at Starbucks (not Seattle's Best) I was holding over my   <br />head.</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>So, what did we do today?&#160; This morning, not much.&#160; A quick business meeting for me in the morning, followed by a trip to the market. Registration opened after noon, and the rest of the afternoon was a very fun schmooze fest.&#160; I met my MVP lead as well as lots of other MVP both new and old.&#160; I heard lots of war stories regarding Vista and Orcas which was of course very fun.&#160; Dinner here at the Westin started at 6:30 and finally, now after 11, I'm here wrapping up the day.&#160; Tomorrow morning it's Bill Gates followed by some sessions and a trip to the space museum.&#160; I'm very much looking forward to the day.</p>
<p>Until Tomorrow.&#160; </p>

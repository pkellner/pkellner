[Astro Build](https://astro.build/) has started to become quite popular I believe primarily because [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) has been loosing popularity. It's a much simpler way to build apps that render content (mostly markdown), then using something like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or create-react-app IMHO.

If you've noticed the sudden change in my blog here, it's because I just finished converting to from Jekyl to Astro (it's still hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)).

More articles to come, but just a heads up that is what has happened.

Truth be told, this post is really just a test of creating a new post with using the vs-code plugin FrontMatter.

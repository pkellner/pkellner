<p>I just accidentally discovered that you can run a web page from visual studio by simply dragging the page out of the solution explorer and into a browser.&#160; Who would have known?&#160; I only discovered this because I did that action and thought it would drag the page onto my second monitor so I can edit it.&#160; Another tip which I did know is that you can grab the folder tab of a source page in Visual Studio and drag it to your desktop (second monitor for example) and edit it while stilling seeing the original page.</p>

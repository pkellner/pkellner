<p>When I switched my primary version control from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion">SubVersion</a> to <a href="http://git-scm.com/">GIT</a> (actually, I switched to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial">HG</a> first but later moved to GIT when it seemed that is where most people I know went) I learned it using just the shell prompt (typing git status, etc.).&#160; It gets really tricky really quickly and I would find myself spending lots of time looking at logs trying to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://neverindoubtnet.blogspot.com/">Ward Bell</a> mentioned he had found a tool that he thought stood out above the rest called <a href="http://www.syntevo.com/smartgithg/">SmartGit/HG</a> from <a href="http://www.syntevo.com/">syntevo</a> .&#160; Ward, never having steered me wrong before (well, maybe once, but let’s not talk about that) gave me inspiration to try the tool.&#160; I did, I love it, and for the past year or so it has just gotten better and better with every release.&#160; </p>
<p>Let me give you an example of the kind of thing I love about it.&#160; I just create a new repository and did a few commits to the master branch.&#160; Now, I want to create my own dev branch so I can continue to work and let others be stable.&#160; So, I’m looking at my branch screen and this is what I see:</p>
<p><a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/image6.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/image_thumb6.png" width="521" height="331" /></a> </p>
<p>What’s really awesome is not only can I checkout from the top of my repository, but it is visually showing me my previous revisions and is going to let me just checkout a branch from any of those.&#160; This means, it’s trivial to go back a version, make some changes, then go back on my development branch.</p>
<p>This is just awesome (and the tip of the iceberg of features)</p>

<p>Today was my first time doing 2 presentations during the same day at a professional conference (VSLive, Las Vegas).&#160; Both sessions were fun to present and hopefully the audience got as much out of it as I did.&#160; Lots of great questions, several twitter posts and best of all, they both finished on time (that is, I finished the material at the time I meant to!).</p>
<p>Here is the material for the first presentation:</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p><strong>Build Blazingly Fast ASP.NET Apps with 100% Clientside UI ExtJS</strong></p>
<blockquote><h6>Intermediate</h6>
<p>Need a web application that has the responsiveness and interactivity of a forms app but still looks and feels like a web? One of the best kept secrets (at least to the Microsoft community) is ExtJS. It's a different paradigm then we are all use to, but the results are spectacular. Take a look at this url and you will see as well as learn how to do this yourself. The hardest part is shuttling the data back and forth. A lot of this session will be talking about how to do a real world app that does this. Once you go this way, you'll be gone from serverside forms for almost ever.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Building High Performance ASP.NET Web Applications </strong></p>
<blockquote><h6>Intermediate</h6>
<p>Topics will include appropriate use of Cache and Session State, as well as how and when to use them. Viewstate management and methods to minimize its use will be discussed. Code to pop up a warning when a threshold is met in development will be shown. When and how to take advantage of Server Farms will be discussed, as well as trouble shooting techniques to find problems. The evils of Server Affinity, as well as a common pattern for caching database queries will be shown to be wrong. Time permitting, we will talk about using Microsoftâ€™s Ajax.asp.net with UpdatePanel and webservices and how these affect performance and scalability.</p>

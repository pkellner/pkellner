<p>This past Wednesday, I presented a front end performance session for how to make web sites work well.&#160; I primarily covered the content from from Steve Souders Excellent book, High Performance Web Sites: Essential Knowledge for Front-End Engineers.</p>

<p>Not being a browser engineer, my knowledge is not the best in that area so probably the talk was a little dry.&#160; We did spend a bunch of time talking about the the Sprite library just released to codeplex from the <a href="http://www.asp.net/">Asp.Net</a> team.&#160; That was&#160; a great discussion!&#160; I plan on talking more about that at my upcoming DevConnections talks in Orlando (very soon).&#160; One interesting note was that there was a browser compatibility slide regarding sprites from Microsoft.&#160; One of the attendees said “Peter, are you sure that Sprites are only supported on IE 8 and above?”.&#160; I said I was sure that is what the document that I got from Microsoft said.&#160; Well, I had several emails today with the Asp.Net team including the author of the document and though I don’t know the final answer, I’m sure that the Microsoft document was wrong on browser compatibility.&#160; It seems that css and sprite support would work all the back to IE6.&#160; When I know more, I’ll post a comment below with a link.&#160; I’m sure Microsoft plans on updating that doc.</p>
<p>That’s it for now.&#160; Below are some pictures from before the meeting.&#160; I’d say that we had about 75 people in attendance.</p>

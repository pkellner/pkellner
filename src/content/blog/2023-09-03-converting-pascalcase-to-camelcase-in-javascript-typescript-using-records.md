description: When you're knee-deep in data transformations, the little things like converting object keys from PascalCase to camelCase can become surprisingly complex. But what if you're working with TypeScript and need to maintain that strong type checking? In our latest blog post, we delve into this very topic. We dissect TypeScript's `Record` type for maximum flexibility and robustness, explain how `Object.entries()` is a game-changer for object manipulation, and walk you through each step of the conversion process with simple string operationsâ€”no regular expressions involved. Whether you're a TypeScript newbie or a seasoned veteran, this post will expand your toolkit for data transformations.

# Converting PascalCase to CamelCase in TypeScript: A Type-Safe Approach with CatList

> ðŸš¨ **Critical Warning (Updated on September 7th, 2023)**: Although the code examples and methodologies discussed in this blog post are technically correct, they exhibit serious shortcomings when deployed in real-world applications. For an in-depth look at these deficiencies, and how to address them, please read [this urgent follow-up post](https://peterkellner.net/2023/09/07/How-ChatGPT-Scares-Me-When-Writing-Code/).

One of the advantages of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is type safety, which helps ensure your data behaves as you expect. A task that can come up fairly often is the conversion of object keys from PascalCase to [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case). In this blog post, we'll explore how to accomplish this transformation while leveraging TypeScript's type-safe capabilities, specifically through the [Record](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type) type and `Object.entries()` function.

## Record Type in TypeScript: An Asset for Type Safety

The `Record` type is an invaluable tool for creating type-safe objects in TypeScript. Consider the following line:

```typescript
let camelCaseCats: Record<string, typeof cat[keyof typeof cat]> = {};
```

With `Record<K, T>`, we can dictate that the keys (`K`) will be strings and the values (`T`) will hold the same type as those in our `cat` object. This is TypeScriptâ€™s built-in mechanism for guaranteeing that both the keys and values conform to the expected types.

## Unlocking Object Iteration with Object.entries()

The function `Object.entries()` is native to JavaScript and also usable in TypeScript. It takes an object and returns an array containing its own enumerable property `[key, value]` pairs, making object iteration a breeze.

```typescript
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(cat)) {
  // Perform operations here
}
```

## A Complete Example: Converting CatList Array to CamelCase

Let's assume we have an array called `catList`, each element of which is an object of type `Cats`. The keys in these `Cats` objects are in PascalCase, and we aim to convert them to camelCase.

Here's our type and sample data:

```typescript
type Cats = {
  CatName: string;
  IsHungry: boolean;
  LastFedDate: string | null;
};

const catList: Cats[] = [
  {
    CatName: "Whiskers",
    IsHungry: true,
    LastFedDate: "2023-09-01"
  },
  {
    CatName: "Fluffy",
    IsHungry: false,
    LastFedDate: null
  }
];
```

To perform the conversion while maintaining type safety through the `Record` type, we can do:

```typescript
function convertToCamelCase(str: string): string {
  return str.charAt(0).toLowerCase() + str.slice(1);
}

const camelCasedCats = catList.map(cat => {
  let camelCaseCats: Record<string, typeof cat[keyof typeof cat]> = {};
  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(cat)) {
    camelCaseCats[convertToCamelCase(key)] = value === null ? 'unassigned' : value;
  }
  return camelCaseCats;
});

console.log(camelCasedCats);
```

Upon executing this code, `camelCasedCats` will become an array of objects with camelCased keys. TypeScript's type safety will be maintained thanks to the `Record` type.

## Generalizing This Approach

After implementing this logic specifically for our `catList` array, you might be wondering how to make this solution more generalized. Indeed, creating a reusable function to convert PascalCase to camelCase can be beneficial for various scenarios. So, let's see how we can build a generic utility function for this task.

### Convertible: A Generic Type

The first step is to define a generic type that describes the objects we'll be converting. In TypeScript, this could be designed like so:

```typescript
type Convertible<T> = Record<string, typeof T[keyof T]>;
```

Here, `Convertible<T>` serves as a blueprint for any object that has string keys and values of some type `T`.

### Utility Function: `mapToCamelCaseObject`

Next, we craft a utility function that utilizes this generic type:

```typescript
export const mapToCamelCaseObject = <T>(inputObject: Convertible<T>): Convertible<T> => {
  let camelCaseResult: Convertible<T> = {};
  const convertToCamelCase = (input: string): string => 
    input.length === 0 ? '' : input.charAt(0).toLowerCase() + input.slice(1);

  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(inputObject)) {
    camelCaseResult[convertToCamelCase(key)] = value === null ? 'unassigned' : value;
  }
  return camelCaseResult;
};
```

In this function, `inputObject` is of type `Convertible<T>`, making the function applicable to a variety of object types. The conversion logic is the same as before, but now it's packaged into a reusable function.

### Sample Usage

Using this utility function is straightforward. Let's say you have an array of objects in PascalCase (e.g., `catList`), you could convert it to camelCase like so:

```typescript
// Assuming catList is already defined
const camelCaseCats = catList.map(mapToCamelCaseObject);
```

By generalizing this approach, we've made it easy to apply PascalCase to camelCase conversion across different types of data structures. This keeps your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and makes it more maintainable and scalable.


## Conclusions

We've seen how the task of converting object keys from PascalCase to camelCase can be performed in a type-safe manner using TypeScript. By leveraging the `Record` type, we ensure that our keys and values conform to the data types we expect, mitigating potential errors down the line. Coupled with `Object.entries()`, which facilitates straightforward iteration over object properties, we can accomplish this task with both efficiency and safety.

Understanding these features can go a long way in making your TypeScript code not just functional but also robust. After all, one of the significant benefits of using TypeScript is its type-safe nature, which helps catch potential issues before they turn into runtime errors. Happy coding!

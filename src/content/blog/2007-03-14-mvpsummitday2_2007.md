<p>From Left to right, Mike Banavige, Ryan Olshan, Terri Morton and Peter Kellner (me).&#160; I did meet Jeff Cochran though out of water I hardly&#160; recognized him. I heard from Dinakar Nethi several times            <br />but have not met him yet (my mission for day 4).</p>

<p>Yesterday and today were packed with information, presentations, old friends and new ones.&#160; Tuesday started with Bill Gates describing the future. After that, we've just had session after session. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a> did his usual     <br />awesome job of showing the future, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bgold/">Brian Goldfarb</a> Demo'd the future, and <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=10276">Anders Hijlsberg</a> described how we will code our way to the future and unfortunately for me, when the Ajax.net guys presented I had the lunch times snoozes and had a real hard time keeping up.&#160; I'm sure it was great and it certainly was stuff I need to know.</p>

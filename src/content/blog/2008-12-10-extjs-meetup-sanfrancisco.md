<p>As many of you know, I'm learning the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/JavaScript:Home_Page">JavaScript</a> library <a href="http://extjs.com/">ExtJS</a>.&#160; It's basically a very rich development api that allows you to make totally awesome client side control 100% in JavaScript.&#160; It has control that include Grid, Dropdown, Calendar, Image, Drag and Drop, Toolbars, etc.&#160; With ExtJS, you can in a very straight forward way, make interfaces that look like the following:</p>
<p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/image1.png" width="441" height="236" /></p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>You can see lots of examples of using ExtJS (usually called E-X-T) here:&#160; http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/samples.html</p>
<p>At our first meetup, we talked about EXT some and also raffled off a copy of the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1847195148/petkelsblo-20">ExtJS book</a> called <a href="/2008/11/28/extjs-bookreview/">Learning Ext JS</a> generously given to us by one of the authors, Shea Frederick.&#160; We also talked about things we could do together as a group. For our first group project, we decided to work on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130403032050/http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Sessions.aspx">sessions page of Silicon Valley Code Camp</a> (the site I wrote) and make that page EXTd.&#160; We broke down parts of that into little pieces and each of us went home with a small assignment to work on.&#160; We plan on meeting again January 20th, 2009 and continue the fun.</p>
<p>Oh, here is a picture of us in our first meetup at the Courtyard Marriott at 2nd and Folsom (San Francisco)</p>

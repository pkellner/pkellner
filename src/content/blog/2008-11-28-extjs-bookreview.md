<p><em>***(This book has been replaced by a new one from the same authors titled <a href="/2011/01/02/learning-ext-js-3-2-from-packt-is-another-winner/">Learning Ext JS 3.2</a> and you should order that one and not this one)</em><br />
<br/><br/><br />
I've been learning ExtJS now for a couple months and it's great to see someone has written a book for it. I just bought it and downloaded the E-Book version of it and from what I can tell it looks great.  I'll post a more detailed review later, but for now, here is where you can get it.</p>
<div id="scid:7dc1bd33-94bd-46fd-a20b-0131235bcd47:443a174d-ea13-45df-8997-e4a828355fb2" class="wlWriterSmartContent" style="margin: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding: 0px;">
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="400">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="400" valign="top"><a title="Amazon.com: Learning Ext JS" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1847195148/petkelsblo-20"><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1847195148.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="left" />Amazon.com: Learning Ext JS</a></td>

<p>(Note:  2/11/09:  I love this book.  I still plan on writing a more detailed review, but for now, I thought I'd put a brief comment.  I carry it around with me every where  go (almost everywhere).  It has great examples and great explanations -Peter)</p>

<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/default.aspx">Windows 7</a> now (Build 7000) for about 2 weeks and am very happy with it.&#160; I still get some strange behavior now and again, but overall, it’s been very stable.&#160; I much prefer it to either XP or Vista.&#160; I do find some software I can’t easily get to work (which is no surprise), but if I really need it (like I do GoToMeeting), I usually figure out a way to make it work.</p>
<p>So, for GoToMeeting, if you launch it from their web site (<a href="http://www.gotomeeting.com">http://www.gotomeeting.com</a>) and simply say “Create Meeting”, you will get an error saying IE8 is not supported.&#160; I found that if I actually downloaded the GoToMeeting application from their web site, then move the application to my start bar and set the properties to be “Run As Vista” and “Run As Administrator”, I had success.</p>
<p><a href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image6.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image_thumb1.png" width="298" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Hopefully, this will work for you.</p>

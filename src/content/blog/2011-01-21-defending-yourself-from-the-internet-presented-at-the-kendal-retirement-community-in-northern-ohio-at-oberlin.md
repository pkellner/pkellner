<p>I had a great time tonight presenting to about 40 people at <a href="http://kao.kendal.org/">Kendal</a>, an awesome retirement community in Northern Ohio, at Oberlin.&#160; This was my first ever presentation to a group of people that were as mature as this group is.&#160; As always, I encouraged lots of questions and I was not disappointed.&#160; I taught the meaning of https and when to use it, I went over lots of topics around email, we talked about public/private key in detail, purchasing on line, paypal and lots of other topics.&#160; I had originally planned on Tuesday, their normal day for presentations, but unfortunately I a little bout with a virus and had to postpone. </p>

<p>The computer steering committee took me to dinner before the presentation</p>

<p>Part of the group showed up on schedule, but quite a few wandered in. I actually heard people went out and got their friends.&#160; </p>
<p>And finally, my slide deck</p>

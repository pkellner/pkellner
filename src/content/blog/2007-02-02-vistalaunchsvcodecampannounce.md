<p align="left">Anand Iyer (The Microsoft Evangelist that blogs at <a href="http://www.artificialignorance.net">http://www.artificialignorance.net</a>     <br />) asked me if I wanted to talk about our upcoming code camp at FootHill College. Having the opportunity to speak in front of hundreds of people about Code Camp seemed was to good a possibility to pass up, so of course     <br />I enthusiastically agreed to say a few words. </p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p align="left">I let everyone know what Code Camp's are and what a great community event put on by developers and for developers is.&#160; I let them know we had a very successful one in    <br /><a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/">Silicon Valley at Foothill College</a> last October and we were just starting the planning of the next one which will likely be the same time frame.&#160; I went on further to talk about what a perfect opportunity it is for both first time speakers as well as veteran's to talk about their favorite topics (once my microphone started working).</p>
<p align="left">There were however some interesting asp.net questions that came up that hopefully I fielded pretty well. Other than that, it was fun to see some local buddies.</p>

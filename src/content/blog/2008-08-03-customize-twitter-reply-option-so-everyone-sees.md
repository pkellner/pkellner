<p>I've had a love/hate relationship with <a href="http://twitter.com/home">Twitter</a> for the past many months.&#160; I really like the idea, I've got a pretty good community I interact with, and for the most part it works.&#160; The hate part is that it is down way to often.&#160; I often see posts where people say &quot;Why to we stick with this sucky service?&quot;.&#160; OK, maybe they don't always use the sucky word.&#160; At any rate, since this is my first Twitter post, I figure I should say that right away.</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>So, the purpose of this post is to let people know of kind of hidden setting in Twitter called &quot;@Replies:&#160; Show me ...&quot;.&#160; <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a> twittered about this a while back and I've finally gotten around to looking it up. Basically, this is so that if someone does a @Reply to you, that you see the reply whether or not you are following them.&#160; Since Scott posted it, I'm going to make a twitter post thanking him for his suggestion and see if he gets it.&#160; Last I checked, he wasn't following my Twitter feed so this will be a good test.</p>
<p>Well, that's about it.&#160; Below is a screen shot of the settings Dialog you need to set.&#160; Just remember, if you don't set this, and people mention your name in a tweet, you may not see it unless you are subscribed to it.&#160; Then, on the upside, you may not want to see it.</p>

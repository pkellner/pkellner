<p>It seems like every project I’m involved in at some point turns into a sync project.&#160; Tomorrow night, I’ll talk about the different efforts Microsoft has put forth in this area, I’ll talk specifically about Azure Sync and of course many of my efforts.&#160; Specifically, I’ll give lots of opinions on how to sync between mobile clients and back end services (my favorite topic at the moment).&#160; We’ll talk about what Azure Mobile Services is, and we’ll talk about what I’m guessing it will be.</p>
<p>Come down and join the talk!&#160; There will be many interactive parts as always.</p>

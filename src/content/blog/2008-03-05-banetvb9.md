<p> Beth did a great job of presenting new features in Visual Studio 2008 at the Bay.Net Meeting in San Francisco.&#160; Her focus was Visual Basic.&#160; Most of the features she presented will work in both C# and VB.&#160; Lots of LINQ stuff.&#160; What really surprised me was the superior handling of LINQ to XML in VB9.&#160; I always thought C# (my language of choice) was better in all ways than VB but I was sadly surprised.&#160; I may have to learn VB now.</p>

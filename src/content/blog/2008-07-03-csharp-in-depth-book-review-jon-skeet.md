<p>First off, I wasn't in the market to buy a c# book, but after seeing that Jon published one by <a href="http://www.manning.com/">Manning</a> I couldn't stop myself.&#160; Jon has been such a great and prolific poster on the internet forums that If felt at a minimum I should support him in his book effort, and Manning, always seems to bring us great books.&#160; I have been <strong>totally happy</strong> with my decision.&#160; It's a great book.&#160; I don't know Jon personally, but after reading the introduction and premise, it's hard not to just really like this guy.</p>
<p>So, on to the review...</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>Jon does a great job right from the start of explaining c#.&#160; One nice thing he does through out the book is he talks about the feature as it moved from version 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0.&#160; For example, he talks about delegates and how the new feature in 3.0 makes it so much easier and more clear to read and write delegates.&#160; Same thing with anonymous methods.&#160; His writing style is clear and concise and he's got lots of great examples.</p>
<p>I'm now a big <a href="http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/">Jon Skeet</a> fan, hope you will be also.</p>

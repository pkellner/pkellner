<p>My 3rd Pluralsight  Sencha training video is now live.  Basically I take you through the steps of building a straight forward conference session viewer application using most of the new features in ExtJS 5.</p>
<p class="p1">The major new features in this upgrade from Sencha that are explained include Model-View-View-Model (MVVM) architecture, 2-way data binding, formulas, tablet support, Routing Translations, and significant new capabilities with models and stores.</p>
<p class="p1">This is my third training video on Sencha's technology.  The first was Sencha Touch, the second ExtJS Fundamentals (which this course builds on) and of course this one on ExtJS 5.  If you have not programmed Sencha's ExtJS before, it is strongly advised that you watch the fundamentals video first.  That will give you a strong foundation for learning ExtJS 5.</p>

description: Microsoft published my third article in a series on how to use Membership
  in ASP.NET 2.0 with an ObjectDataSource.  That is, extending Membership into three
  tiers.  This article takes what was developed in article two and adds Atlas extensions
  to make it work even better.  The Article on MSDN uses the March CTP (Community
  Technology Preview).  There is an update on my blog as well as a download to make
  it work correctly with the June CTP.

<p>Microsoft just published my third article. This one is titled: &quot;Member/Role Management with IIS, Part 3: AJAX Enhancements with Microsoft’s Atlas&quot;.</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479398.aspx">MSDN here</a>, or on my blog here.</p>
<p>Here is the introduction.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This article extends one of the web pages developed in Part II of this series using Microsoft’s implementation of AJAX called Atlas. It utilized two techniques for reducing web server traffic to the browser to enhance the users web experience. The first technique uses the UpdatePanel tags to limit the refreshed area of the web page to limited areas and the second has to do with implementing some javascript using Atlas techniques so that the web page is updated on every key stroke in a textbox. A user list is displayed based on what is actively typed into this textbox. After reading this article the developer will be able to implement AJAX (Microsoft’s implementation Atlas) in their own application.</p>

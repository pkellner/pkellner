<p>Over the past couple years, the focus of the web development I’ve been doing involves building highly flexible, highly scalable and straight forward web sites to implement and maintain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_business">Line of Business</a> (LOB) applications.&#160; As you can probably tell from my posts, I’m very “practical” focused, and at the same time have a desire to build awesome web applications.</p>
<p>The technology pairing I’ve chosen is Microsoft’s .Net platform with MVC on the server, and <a href="http://www.extjs.com/">ExtJS</a> on the client.&#160; Though it’s possible to still use ExtJS with standard html/aspx pages, I’ve found the best combination is to use 100% <a href="http://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a> on the client (ExtJS) and have all the server side technology be 100% service based.&#160; I’ve used <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx">LINQ2SQL</a> extensively as well as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee336128.aspx">Entity Framework</a> in the latest <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx">Visual Studio 2010</a> release.</p>
<p>The learning curve was quite steep to actually be able to efficiently build highly flexible, highly scalable applications using these technologies, but now that I know it, I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
<p>I’m considering putting together a series of <strong>4 Day Classes</strong> around the country (or even world) that would basically teach people the methods and patterns I’ve learned and essentially leap frog a development team into being able to quickly do what it has taken me years to figure out.&#160; I’ve been fortunate enough to know the top 1% instructors and I’m sure with the right incentive, can get them to join me in both putting together these classes as well as teaching them.</p>

<p>So, my question is:</p>
<p> [poll id=2]
<p>I really appreciate your feedback.&#160; If I go down this path, it will be a lot of work and it would be nice to know if people are really interested.&#160; I know for myself, I' would have gone to something like this 2 years ago and it would have saved me a lot of time.</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>

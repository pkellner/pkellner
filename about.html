    <li>
      Successfully delivered systems for university clinic scheduling, insurance
      company management, and a turnkey physician office management system for
      more than 500 customers nationwide.
    </li>
    <li>
      Developed a medical software suite that included electronic billing which
      aggregated insurance claims, securely sent them to a central location, and
      then distributed them to the appropriate online insurance carriers. The
      technologies involved native TCP/IP secure connections on Windows 2000
      clients and Unix servers running Oracle with substantial business logic on
      the servers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Developed a two-year project to replace the online processing of a $200
      million annual revenue insurance company in Florida. This project involved
      both architecting a sophisticated three-tier application that managed all
      business processes of this insurance company from adjudicating claims,
      billing groups, as well as paying commission-based brokers and sales
      people. The project was delivered and signed off successfully and
      <strong><em>on schedule</em></strong

  <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
  <p><b>Leadership</b></p>
  <p>
    Leadership is about developing and keeping the group focused on common goals
    and then enthusiastically working toward them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having founded and built from the ground up a computer business that
    included custom software, sales, service and training, I’ve learned how
    important the team is to the success of achieving goals. That said, it’s
    important to keep perspective, and when common consensus is orthogonal to
    common goals, it’s most important to educate and steer the group towards a
    better consensus. Often, that’s the biggest challenge and its importance
    cannot be understated.
  </p>
  <p><b>Reliability Engineering</b></p>
  <p>
    Reliability engineering is about making sure that the software produced is
    engineered and tested in a way to have minimal problems and performs to
    expectations. High quality engineering processes and people are critical to
    delivering products that will have the highest probability of success at
    achieving their goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my career, reliability engineering has always been my primary focus when
    building and delivering services and products. From my first job out of
    college, working at Lockheed Missiles and Space, where rocket launches are
    successful only when every part works, to building high speed LDAP
    authentication servers for Gannett, my focus and passion is and has always
    been achieving appropriately high reliability.
  </p>
  <p><b>Legacy Migrations</b></p>
  <p>
    Successful legacy migration of existing system is about successfully
    replacing underlying implementations of user requirements from one (usually
    older) technology to another one. &nbsp;Often, system being replaced are
    either not scaling to meet needs, are no longer maintainable or do not meet
    expanded requirements without significant changes. They key is almost always
    evolution rather than revolution. Building and testing sub systems and
    replacing them one at a time is almost always the best approach for success.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the time I founded 73rd Street Associates and
    ultimately sold to Vision Service Plan (VSP), we did 4 major technology
    shifts while moving our hundreds of remote customers though each transition
    successfully. &nbsp;Following that, I’ve worked with many companies
    migrating legacy system to newer technologies. &nbsp;The model for success
    I’ve always used, starts with having a very clean specification for what the
    requirements of the new system need to be, what the final deliverable should
    achieve, and having a clear and agreed upon definition of what success looks
    like for everyone.
  </p>
  <p><b>Solution Architecture</b></p>
  <p>
    Solution Architecture is about describing what technologies and components
    are required to solve a given problem. &nbsp;In architecting a solution,
    understanding the problem to be solved is the number one priority.
  </p>
  <p>
    At Transportation Logistics, I architected a freight processing system that
    queued and processed incoming freight requests. &nbsp;On demand
    consolidation plans were created as needed while highly optimized delivery
    schedules were created daily based on up to the minute data updates.
    &nbsp;Regenerations of the these plans could be requeued as often as
    necessary. We spent 60% of the project time understanding the problem to
    solve, writing requirements with quick user interface prototypes and
    designing the architecture. In the remaining time we developed the solution
    in a series of sprints with customer review and adjustments. First release
    delivered a fully working solution that fully met the customer needs. It’s
    critical for the success of the architecture that sufficient time is
    &nbsp;spent understanding the problem to be solved. &nbsp;The solution
    implementation is also important but care always needs to be taken to avoid
    shortchanging the architecture work.
  </p>
  <p><b>Full Stack Engineering</b></p>
  <p>
    Full stack engineering is about being able to architect and build all the
    moving parts necessary to create applications that persist data to servers,
    reliably process requests from remote devices (desktops and mobile devices)
    and provide excellent user experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Successfully growing Silicon Valley Code Camp, Code Stars Summit and
    AngularU conference sites over many years to a community of over twenty
    thousand members has its roots in my ability to lead a team to develop a
    full stack web application to manage all the details. Currently, the
    community around Silicon Valley Code Camp enjoys receiving over a million
    correspondences a year, all tracked. The site processes credit cards for
    registration classes and more, as well as supports for both desktop and
    mobile devices.
  </p>
  <p><b>Managing Remote Engineering Teams</b></p>
  <p>
    Managing remote engineering teams is about understanding the value add that
    can be achieved by using off site engineering resources. Understand (or
    providing) the remote leadership structure is critical as well as
    understanding the culture that team respects.
  </p>
  <p>
    At PSM, I managed a growing team of Ukrainian engineers who were tasked with
    short delivery cycles to produce both high quality, designed to specs and
    upgradeable deliverables. Key to making this team successful was making sure
    that the remote team understood the requirements and had ample time and
    permission to push back Another project, where I was tasked to work with a
    team of engineers from the Philippines, had different challenges. This team
    would often do exactly as requested without question or comment. To make
    this team successful it was essential to give clear instructions, to spent a
    lot of time ensuring the instructions were understood and to schedule
    frequent status updates.
  </p>
  <p><b>Professional Training</b></p>
  <p>
    Professional Training is about not just teaching the what and how but also
    the why. It’s about passing on best practice thought processes to solve
    problems both large and small.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a Pluralsight author, I’ve done seven multi-hour training videos, and
    like all authors I ensure my courses are technically correct and provide
    value above the written documentation. I also take pride in going beyond the
    basics and provide explanations of the reasons behind the requirements and
    constraints. For example, in my ASP.NET Core Tag Helpers course, tag queries
    are limited, confusing and non-intuitive. To fully explain this I showed the
    Microsoft Tag Helper source code highlighting the Tag Helper implementation
    and specifically the hardcoded, not likely to change, limitations.
  </p>
  <p><b>Software Tooling Enthusiast</b></p>
  <p>
    Software tooling is about making sure that when you work on a software
    project, you are prepared to work efficiently and correctly.
    &nbsp;Understanding how much tooling is needed is very important to the
    overall success of many projects. It is tempting to move too quickly to
    product development and not take the time to build the tools that create
    efficiencies for development throughout the project.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my career, I’ve always made a point to spend time both at the beginning
    of projects I work on as well as during, to make sure my tooling is
    excellent. &nbsp;While working with Gannett to implement multi-tenant
    authentication on their high speed LDAP servers, early on, I worked with the
    team to build a multithreaded request simulator to simulate complex loading
    patterns. &nbsp;Ultimately, this simulator uncovered a bug that Novell fixed
    in the secure socket layer implementation.

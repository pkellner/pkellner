<div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><h2>Translating Truth from Hype</h2>
  <p>Truth be told, one of my superpowers is an internal BS meter. I’m able to translate techno-geek into integration strategies that drive business solutions. That’s why CTO’s tap into my experience with <a href="/solutions-architect/">solution architecture</a> and <a href="/migration-strategies/">migration strategies</a>.&nbsp;Having founded and built — from the ground up — a computer business that included custom software, sales, service,&nbsp;and training, I understand how legacy systems and new technologies fit together.</p>
  <h2>An Objective CTO Advisor</h2>
  <p>When CTOs want an objective evaluation, they call me to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weed through RFPs, user requirements, and system capabilities</strong> to determine what’s possible and what’s not</li>
    <li><strong>Translate business requirements</strong> into migration plans</li>
    <li><strong>Create clean specifications</strong> so teams have everything they need to achieve success</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I have experience in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Building&nbsp;the architecture for full stack engineering</li>
    <li>Managing remote Engineering teams</li>
    <li>Creating training that memorializes institutional knowledge and standard operating procedures</li>
    <li>Authoring training courses covering JavaScript frameworks such as React and ExtJS, Microsoft web technologies, Node, SQL Server, Redis and others</li>
    <li>Organizing technical communities for educational and networking growth</li>
  </ul>

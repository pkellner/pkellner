        <h2>Been there, done that, happy to help you do it!</h2>
        <p>
          I totally get it. You've got your current web site in a technology
          that's good but not great. Everyone's talking about SPA's, Serverless,
          Server-side, TypeScript and more. Let me help you devise a plan, and
          help you execute so that you are getting the best bang for your web
          site dollars.
        </p>
        <h2>Specifically, I can help with:</h2>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
          <li>
            <strong>Making a Plan.</strong>&nbsp; This is the most important
            part. I'll work with you to figure out what you've got, what can be
            re-used and what needs to be re-written. We'll make time estimates
            and give you a real idea of where you stand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Help Train Your Staff.</strong> Let me help get your staff
            up to speed with what they need to know. Lots of consultants love to
            come in and become a forever part of your team.&nbsp; Not me. I want
            to get in, get out and leave you in a much better place.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Code Quality.</strong> I'm hard wired to build quality code.
            Let me help you get your team hardwired the same way.&nbsp; Testing
            enough (testing too much?), Using TypeScript (maybe you should,
            maybe you should not), are you using your version control well?
            branching strategies? How about coding documentation. These days
            it's amazing easy to build docs that not only help you maintain your
            information for posterity (OK, not that useful) but let's your team
            use it for reference. Let me show you how to make that a part of
            your culture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deployment Strategy.</strong> Do you have a great continuous
            build and deploy process in place? Source control directly to
            production? If not, I can help. Nothing makes me happier then to
            check into a production branch and then 30 minutes later, after all
            testing passes, the web site is live and in production with the
            latest update.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>On-boarding New Staff.</strong> Let me help you with a plan
            for this. It's never free to teach your new engineers, but it can be
            a lot cheaper and better than it probably is.
          </li>

        <h2>What Others Say</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “As CEO of VisionCare, Inc., I contracted with Peter Kellner to
            replace our aging computer system. Our company depends on the computer
            system for millions of dollars in annual claims processing, broker
            payments, and physician payments as well as many other critical
            functions. Peter and his team were great at communicating issues as
            they came up, resolving them, and, most importantly, delivering a
            properly working system on schedule. We had a team of six QA people
            verify that everything converted perfectly, and the new programs
            worked exactly as specified. I can’t say it is ever a pleasure to
            change computer systems, but it was a pleasure working with Peter
            and his team!”<br />—
            <em>Howard Braverman, O.D., CEO, VCI</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “Peter is a very passionate person. His knowledge of AngularJS is
            beyond comparison.”<br />— <em>Caro Waelens, RFID </em>and<em>
              Data Analyst</em
            >
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “Peter delivers complex product solutions on time and on budget. He
            achieves this through a well rounded, insightful business
            perspective coupled with impressive technical depth and breadth.
            Even when we were faced with the most difficult of challenges, Peter
            was a resourceful problem solver with far-reaching connections into
            Microsoft and many open source projects. I believe his most unique
            ability is to utilize technology to solve real customer problems,
            not just for technology’s sake. Peter will be a strong asset to any
            team.”<br />—

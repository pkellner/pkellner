  <h2>Containing &amp; Bridging Systems</h2>
  <p>
    Successful legacy migration of an existing system is about successfully
    replacing underlying implementations of user requirements from one (usually
    older) technology to another one. Often, the&nbsp;system being replaced is
    either not scaling to meet current or future business needs. Or, it’s no
    longer maintainable or expandable without significant changes. The&nbsp;key
    is almost always evolution rather than revolution. Building and testing
    subsystems and replacing them one at a time is almost always the best
    approach for success.
  </p>
  <p>
    With decades of experience, I’ve created and executed migration strategies
    for a variety of industries, including {insert industries}. When the systems
    to be migrated are business critical, the stakes are high. That’s where my
    background and technical expertise can make the process easier and run more
    smoothly.

  <h2>Migration Strategies for Evolving Business Needs</h2>
  <p>
    From the time I founded 73rd Street Associates and ultimately sold to Vision
    Service Plan (VSP), I did 4 major technology shifts while moving our
    hundreds of remote customers through each transition successfully. Following
    that, I’ve worked with many companies migrating their&nbsp;legacy system to
    newer technologies. The model for success I’ve used includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Starting with clean specifications</strong> for what the new
      system’s requirements of the new system
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Defining what success</strong> looks like for everyone, gaining
      support from stakeholders, DevOps, and all affected business functions
    </li>
    <li><strong>Containing apps </strong>and taking inventory of all assets</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Creating a service layer</strong> that provides consistent
      interfaces to each of the legacy systems
    </li>
    <li><strong>Bridging the service layers</strong> to bring them together</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Finalizing deliverables</strong> and wrapping up any development
      loose ends
    </li>
  </ul>

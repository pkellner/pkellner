  <h2>Creating Structure &amp; Consistency</h2>
  <p>
    Solution Architecture creates the blueprint for a business to achieve its
    goals through software development. All too often I find that organizations
    have rich institutional knowledge that hasn’t been memorialized. They have
    amassed a pattern of software coding that works for their product or
    service. Yet, it’s only senior and architects who know and follow those
    patterns. Imagine the new engineer tasked with something simple like a
    login&nbsp;for an app. “No problem,” they say. They begin to code like they
    did on their previous job. While they technically completed the task, much
    of it needs to be redone so it flows with engineering standards.”
    Documenting those coding patterns and standards is one way to reduce
    onboarding time with new engineers and create coding consistency across
    existing engineering teams.

    That’s where my talents shine. I’ve created dozens of Pluralsight training
    videos to solve these types of issues and
    <strong

    so there is clear guidance for new engineers to follow.

  <h2>Solving Solution Architecture Problems</h2>
  <p>When working with my clients, I often hear:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We have <strong>multiple engineering teams</strong>. They’re tasked with
      working on the same problem yet they don’t know it. We end up with
      multiple solutions costing us more money; then to make things worse, we
      have to maintain them all.
    </li>
    <li>
      We don’t have a <strong>consistent architecture</strong> that allows us to
      move quickly and efficiently. We haven’t established an engineering
      development process — software tooling,&nbsp;structure, behavior and good
      ci-cd process to bring it all together — that enables us to innovate and
      deliver what the business needs to compete.
    </li>
    <li>
      Our <strong>DevOps&nbsp;strategies</strong> need to be retooled. We want
      our development processes and staging servers to make production more
      reliable. We hear a lot about things like docker and kubernetes but don’t
      where to start.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Security is always a top priority</strong> but we don’t know if we
      are spending too much or too little.
    </li>
    <li>
      While we have a <strong>code review process</strong>, it’s apparent there
      isn’t a good balance between engineers and QA engineers.
    </li>
    <li>
      We frequently <strong>onboard new engineers</strong> but we waste valuable
      engineering while our top engineers do basic training. It would be great
      if we had a fast way to onboard new engineers without slowing down our
      engineering production.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
